    A little animation experiment to a short loop of music as a break between art commissions and album work.

    Also included as an SWF file with [[album:induction]], released a couple months later.

    [[track:trepidation]] and the outro of [[track:fin-induction]] share a melody ([Fin, 4:10](https://youtu.be/8UFXoZfWagQ?t=250)), but the production order isn't entirely clear. This flash contains the very beginning of Trepidation, and is the earliest release of anything to do with this melody, published on Svix's YouTube in January 2012. Fin is the bonus track on Induction and was released with the album in March (and later on YouTube [in May](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UFXoZfWagQ)). Finally, the full track Trepidation was included on [[album:homestuck-vol-9]], released in June 2012.

    Although the twenty second snippet of Trepidation in this flash is the earliest release of all, a comment Svix wrote on Fin suggests a full-length track, presumably Trepidation, was arranged/extended from Fin's outro:

    <i>Svix:</i> ([YouTube comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UFXoZfWagQ&lc=Ugz6McVPlAYqktC2hUl4AaABAg) for [[track:fin-induction]])

    > Nice mixture of different tracks. It looks and sounds like it should be playing along with a MegaMan game or some other old arcade game.
    >
    > And is that a bit of Timeless Miracle I hear in there?

    Thanks, I'm not sure who Timeless Miracle are though so I guess that's coincidence!

    > It's a nice one.  Here's the spot: @4:10 in "Fin" is the part I'm referring to.
    >
    > And it's similar to Timeless Miracle's ["Curse of the Werewolf"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnkWRz5cXgk).  The part in their song is repeated.

    Ah right, I've actually turned that part into a whole track for my new EP :]

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    Since Fin is the bonus track from Induction already, it's possible the "new EP" could have been a planned project that wasn't properly released. Of course, Trepidation was included on Homestuck Vol. 9, so the full track still saw release.

    <i>Stephen Maxwell:</i> ([Tumblr post](https://3phen.tumblr.com/post/5589239614/hammerkind-game-announcement), excerpt)

    Hammerkind is a unique little fangame that I've put a lot of time and love into. It's the first thing of this size I've completed, and I'm really excited to finally let everyone play it!

    Hammerkind features original game mechanics inspired by Homestuck. Fight imps to gather Build Grist to build, to climb through the seven gates to reach Skaia!  This mostly takes place as if in Act 3, though some secrets diverge from this concept if you can find them. If you stick with the game, you can unlock quite a lot of extra content.

    Note that Hammerkind has weird physics, and will not function like most platformers or brawlers. The jump has no air-control, John accelerates quickly while running, and the way attacks work is odd.  A large part of the game is learning to use this to your advantage!
