**Tracks and listening:**

- [ ] Researched listening links for the album across multiple platforms, e.g. Bandcamp, YouTube, SoundCloud, and added these links across all tracks and the main album page
- [ ] Listened to the album all the way through and kept an ear out for any references to existing music from the official Homestuck discography, **even if the album notes/commentary includes reference lists**
- [ ] Took note of any tracks with lyrics and listened them through to write or verify lyrics to the best of your capabilities, **even if the album notes/commentary includes lyrics**
    - View existing lyrics on the wiki for many examples of how we format lyrics: https://hsmusic.wiki/list/tracks/with-lyrics/
- [ ] Removed entries from the "Additional Tracks" albums (where tracks which are referenced on the wiki but aren't yet part of an album that was added to the wiki in its entirety), if this album is the primary release of any tracks there

**Artist commentary:**

- [ ] Included commentary readily available to you
    - This includes copying commentary in **free** commentary booklets. Please check for permission from the artist if a booklet is only included when you purchase the album (see the section on additional files below).
- [ ] Researched each track's artist's own music platforms to see if they've shared commentary independently of the album's main release page
    - This is a bigger task, especially for older releases, so feel free to leave it to someone else if you haven't approached it yet yourself.
- [ ] For commentary released outside a booklet or an album's main release page (usually Bandcamp), especially for "spontaneous" commentary (e.g. publicly replying to a Tumblr ask or a YouTube comment), included links to the commentary source directly within the commentary field
    - Formatting example: https://hsmusic.wiki/track/gold-pilot/
    - Note: This is a standard that we haven't held all commentary on the wiki to in the past, since much of it was sorted out from secondary sources that just copy-pasted commentary without linking the primary source (and some of those primary sources have since gone offline), but in general we try to cite new commentary additions outside the main album release.

Some albums and tracks have audio commentary (e.g. a voice recording after the fact or a live stream of the album featuring commentary from the artists). While we aim to be a comprehensive reference, we usually don't transcribe these on our first pass with an album (instead adding them later as time is available). Please mark the following checkbox, and include links, if there's any audio commentary to come back to later.

- [ ] **This album features audio commentary.**

**Art tags, if applicable:**

- [ ] Added existing art tags to tracks and albums
- [ ] Added content warning art tags to tracks and albums

If this album is for a fanventure or features a group of characters you aren't familiar with, please mark the following checkbox. (We don't always fill out new character art tags at the same time as adding an album, but marking this ensures we'll keep track of it to come back to.)

- [ ] **This album features new character tags.**

**New artists, if applicable:**

- [ ] Added artist visisting links to any newly added artists
- [ ] Based on visiting links and your own awareness, made sure any newly added artists aren't aliases of existing artists
- [ ] To the best of your knowledge, made sure any newly added artists are given their most recent or primary online alias in the `Artist` name field

**New additional files, if applicable:**

- [ ] Ensured you have permission to share any new additional files; in other words, if an album includes bonus content which is only accessible via download when you actually purchase the album, then you've contacted the artists or organizers behind the album and asked if they're OK with this paid content being released publicly. This is generally a no-go for new paid releases, but much older releases are sometimes more flexible.
- [ ] Included freely and publicly available additional files, like artwork or commentary booklets

**Media files:**

- [ ] Downloaded **the best available quality** for any track and album artwork - if you're fetching from Bandcamp, go to the `bcbits.com` URL you use to download the art (right click -> open image in new tab) and change `_10` or `_10.jpg` at the end of the file to `_0`.
- [ ] Added media files (album artwork, new additional files, etc) and created a patch with its commits:
    - Patch link (if it's too large to include directly, use a file-sharing service like Mega or MediaFire):
