    another tumblrstuck/tumblrbent related song.

    rather than a god tier battle theme thingy, this more like... the song that plays at the end of a battle victory. ie. the same damn song that final fantasy has been using since the first game.

    this is not that song though. its a song of my own composition, though its more or less an homage to it i suppose :V

    so. i finally did it.

    after being sorta without any concept of what to do, i finally made a proper strife/prince of mind theme for myself.

    its very hard finding something that encompasses regal tone with intellectual mysteriousness that isn't totally out there and weird.

    also sticking with an instrumentation set fitting for a video game/homestuck.

    anyway yeah.

    i hope you enjoy it.

    yehyehyehyehyeh another god tier theme.

    this one is for BANA who's a pretty cool dude who draws and is a bear sometimes.

    he's got ownership on the classy title of knight of joy.

    so be joyful.

    with this tune.
