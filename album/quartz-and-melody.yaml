    First of 12 EPs.

    To those in the know, it's quite obvious where I'm going with this, to those who're out of the loop, look up Homestuck and come back to me once you're done reading it.

    Took me too long to make this, but I can be satisfied with this; now to find out if I am.

    Piezoelectric Quartz is a bit of a redundancy, all quartz is piezoelectric (meaning it can convert electrical and mechanical energy interchangeably), but only those that know or read this can tell.

    I made this one in record time, I think it's much better than the first track and much more suitable.

    The name is something somewhat clever, it allowed me for great leeway to repeat whatever I want, whenever I wanted it.

    Since this is supposed to be an EP with theme songs related to the lands of Homestuck beta trolls, I thought it'd be well to make an actual theme song of the Quartz bit. I'm not going to remove the first track, it's okay still.
