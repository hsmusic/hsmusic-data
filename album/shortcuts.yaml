Track: A Scape
Artists:
- Marcy Nabors
Duration: '4:52'
URLs:
- https://casualsunday.bandcamp.com/track/a-scape-2
Commentary: |-
    <i>Marcy Nabors:</i>
    Ashburn is your quintessential D.C. suburb. Quiet save for birds, barking dogs, and the subtle but constant drone of faraway highway noise, it's a beautiful and peaceful place to live. Unfortunately, life in Ashburn can get a bit dull after high school: Friends leave for college and there's no easy public transportation to the hour-away city, so there's not much to do outside the house except take walks through the scenic woods and hillsides. If you're not the outdoorsy type (and especially if you work from home), a reclusive life can be easy to fall into. With this song I intend to convey the strange dichotomy between the semi-natural beauty of Ashburn's ample wooded landscape and carefully maintained lawns, and the ever-present plasticity that permeates both the town and my necessarily internet-centric lifestyle.

Track: '14121'

Duration: '4:16'

Commentary: |-
    <i>Catboss:</i>
    14121 kilometers is the approximate distance from Singapore (i.e. where I usually live) to Westwood, Los Angeles, where I currently stay and study. I rounded it up to the nearest number that I could make a tongue-twister out of; it's officially pronounced "one hundred and forty-one hundred and twenty-one." Deal with. Anyway, it's a song about being at home, and also not being at home, at the same time, at all times, and also, places. Because when you think about it, being perpetually [at home] and being perpetually [not at home] are identical states of being. Yes, I'm aware that makes no sense; this song is also about being profoundly disconnected from reality. Have fun!

Lyrics: |-
    everything falling up again<br>broken and beautiful honesty
    the earth shrugs and stares at herself<br>at least it will be over soon
    mix your story with mine<br>hold your breath in my sigh
    i'm alone here<br>and i wish that i wasn't<br>but at least i have peace and quiet
    i look out my window<br>at the cold winter light<br>it shines in my eyes<br>and it sings
Commentary: |-
    <i>Robert J! Lake:</i>
    for much of my adult life i've gone back and forth between living in chicago and northwest indiana, which is where i grew up
    i first realized i had clinical depression when i
    this is a song about
    <br><br>this is a love song

    <i>Corbin Pangilinan:</i>
    Last year, my freshman year of college, I was put into a dorm that was across the street from the campus proper. The first few days of the semester came just fine, but the following weeks slowly fell into the same, everyday rut and I found my routine pretty quickly tiring. For me, the start of every day would be crossing that main street in the city, which had a walk signal, as most city street crossings tend to. I'd push the button, which would evoke a very sharp click (and honestly, it was pretty satisfying to push; the morning ennui pushed me to observe that) and then the walk sign would come on, very rhythmically, stating, "WAIT." When it came time to cross, it always repeated, "WALK SIGN IS ON. WALK SIGN IS ON. WALK SIGN IS-" at which point it would abruptly cut off and begin counting. The total time for crossing came to about thirty seconds or so, and I'd put my head down and walk along with the other freshman or whoever came to that street corner to walk at that particular time. As the semester dragged on, I started to imagine songs in order to break up the monotony a little, to the point where I would be walking across the street completely absorbed in my thoughts until the beeping of the walk signal, awaiting its next input, would come in and I'd find myself across the street. North Walk/South Walk encompasses the feeling of that 30 second time period, and indeed, the essential spirit of my freshman year in Norfolk.

Track: Loop 1
Artists:
- Michael Guy Bowman
Duration: '5:51'
URLs:
- https://casualsunday.bandcamp.com/track/loop-1
Commentary: |-
    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    Loop 1 is the formal name for the Mopac Expressway in Austin, Texas. On the occasions where it's not crowded with stop-and-go commuters, it's a quick way to cut through the quieter reaches of town, navigating through rolling prairie and surreal corporate offices. This track pulls from the sound of krautrock, copping the motorik beat and droning sensibilities of Neu! - a recording from the inside of a car riding along this would-be-autobahn slowly fades in over the escalating loops.

Lyrics: |-
    On noisy urban nights<br>A pulse beneath the skin<br>Lose sight of the evening sky
    The cold fluorescent lights<br>The bodies pressing in<br>Each page a new place to hide
    A look that's calling out<br>A draw to meet their eyes<br>So nervously turn aside
    A human connection?<br>Then head for the escape<br>The doors close the moment slips away
    On noisy urban nights<br>In scraps of poetry<br>All lost to the world outside

    The 'lyrics' to this track are deliberately ommitted. As commentary, providing a transcription would be essentially the same as providing the audio itself, which is purchase-only bonus material.
