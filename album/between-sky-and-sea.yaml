    My fourth album, Between Sky and Sea, is perhaps my most inspired to date. It is half an hour of uplifting synth orchestrals with a handful of contrasting tracks thrown in.

    Several of the tracks here are among my favourites ever, including Like Flying, Fuchsia Moonrise, The Journey and Acquiescence.

    This album could not have been possible without the Undertale soundtrack, which inspired about 30 minutes of the music here (all composed in a single month).
