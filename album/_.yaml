    <i>Makin:</i> (Album namer, album wiki-adder)
    Look, in our defense, we weren't thinking of wikis when coming up with album names. Main volumes just kept getting sillier and sillier, from skipping straight to [[album:cool-and-new-volume-v]] after [[album:cool-and-new-volume-ii]], to emojis in [[album:v8lume]]'s title, to simply naming an album [[album:9]], to now, this, [[album:_]], an album without name, which CAN be represented properly on bandcamp, but obviously cannot usably be represented on a wiki. Thankfully we went back to "[[album:cool-and-new-volume-3]]" after this like reasonable people. Forgive the inaccuracy in using an underscore instead of a blank space. If you want to punish us for our crimes, please do so by listening to the album.

Lyrics: |-
    Wake up in the morning feeling like P-Diddy
    Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city
    Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
    'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

    I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
    Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
    Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
    Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
    Pullin' up to the parties
    Tryna get a little bit tipsy

    Boys blowing up our phones, phones
    Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
    Pulling up to the parties
    Trying to get a little bit tipsy

    Don't stop, make it pop
    DJ, blow my speakers up
    Tonight, I'ma fight
    'Til we see the sunlight
    Tick tock on the clock
    But the party don't stop, no
    
    There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
    It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
    And they turn me on, when they take it off
    When they take it off, everybody take it off

    Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
    Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
    And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
    But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

    I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk, crunk
    Boys tryna touch my junk, junk
    Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
    No-now we go until they kick us out, out or the police shut us down, down
    Police shut us down, down, po-po shut us down
    
    Don't stop, make it pop
    DJ, blow my speakers up
    Tonight, I'ma fight
    'Til we see the sunlight
    Tick tock on the clock
    But the party don't stop, no

    Don't stop, make it pop
    DJ, blow my speakers up
    Tonight, I'ma fight
    'Til we see the sunlight
    Tick tock on the clock
    But the party don't stop, no

    Damela damela bien rica
    Vamonos pa' ca, pa' la esquinita
    Damela que estas bien bonita, mamacita
    Damela, damela pa' aquí, dame pa' llevar
    A mi me gusta como tu lo meneas
    Muévete ese bam bam y grita

    Ah! Bienvenidos a la cripta!

Commentary: |-
    <i>Makin:</i> (Wiki maintainer)
    The author of this track says this quotes a bunch of Homestuck songs with the word "star" in their names, but I can only hear Ocean Stars, and they were only able to remember one more reference, Bridge of Stars, saying that if there are more, they're subtler. If you can hear more, please join the HSMusic Discord and save us.

    In the same vein as cookie's [[track:chronic-jungle-redone|chronic jungle remake]], here is [[track:infection-canmt]] (one of my three call and new 2 tracks) as I would have done it today (also incorporating elements from cookie's new track). I've been actually working on this for a couple months! Well, except the part from 1:57, that's last week's work.

Lyrics: |-
    (The fireflies are dancing in the sky)
    (And your whole family is here)
    (And they're telling you that everything is gonna be all right)
    (Yes)
    (That's right)
    (What else?)
    (The crickets are are chirping, and the lake is still, and the night is full of stars)
    (I can see it)
    (It's so clear)
    (What are we doing here, BoJack?)
    (We're sitting on the back porch, and we're listening to your brother play the piano, and we're eating ice cream)
    (Vanilla ice cream)
    (Yes)
    (That's right)
    (Oh, it's all so marvelous)
    (Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?)
    (Oh, BoJack)
    (It's so delicious)
