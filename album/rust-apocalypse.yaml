    <i>Willow Ascenzo:</i>
    Five exciting new arrangements of my three compositions featured on the album [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|coloUrs and mayhem: Universe A]] by Homestuck, including the monstrous and colossal song "[[track:rust-apocalypse|Rust Apocalypse]]"! The original compositions are included as bonus tracks.
    This EP is not officially related to Andrew Hussie's MSPaint Adventures and the music contained herein is sold as the property of its composer, and not as official Homestuck music.

    “Broken Rainbow” was meant to be a short introduction track that would briefly play over the musical motifs of the rest of the tracks. It’s a short atmospheric piece that quotes a few notes from each composition, “[[track:rust-witch-ascenzo|Rust Witch]]/[[track:rust-apocalypse|Rust Apocalypse]]”, “[[track:teal-hunter|Teal Hunter]]”, and “[[track:violet-mariner|Violet Mariner]]”. The title “Broken Rainbow” is meant to play on the “[[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|coloUrs and mayhem]]” idea and the many-hued character design of Homestuck while also referencing the idea of a “rust apocalypse”.

    “[[track:teal-hunter|Teal Hunter]]” was originally submitted to the [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|coloUrs and mayhem]] music contest as a composition about quad-prototyped Peregrine Mendicant fighting Bec Noir; this arrangement brings the song back to its roots.

    “Teal Hunter” was originally submitted to coloUrs and mayhem under the title “Bête Blanche”, and yes, it was originally a song for prototyped PM. That is what “White Angel” refers to. It’s a bonus remix of “Teal Hunter” referring to the song’s intended character.
