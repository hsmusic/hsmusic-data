    <i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20100908063929/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/), excerpt)

    <b>THIS IS INCREDIBLY SILLY</b>

    Hey guys, guess what the next album is all about! No, your guess is wrong. It is a Squiddles album. Surprise!

    Here is an important thing to note before all else. [This album comes with a full-length animation!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD9DO7P2vbU) That is a link to the trailer. The full version comes with the download.

    A lot of the same people who have contributed to MSPA animations lately worked on that animation. In fact, they did 100% of it! Conceptualized it and storyboarded it and drew all the assets, all under the supervision of a very skilled Flash animator named [[artist:paige-turner|Paige Turner]].

    This album began percolating many months ago, and as with much of what this music fellowship works on, it snowballed in quantity and silliness and awesomeness over an extended period of time. It began with [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alex Rosetti's]] great [[track:squiddles|single track]] (1st in playlist), a snippet of which found its way into the big [[flash:1940|[S] Descend]] mashup.

    The idea we formed around that song was to make an album that would serve as the soundtrack for a fictional cartoon show for kids, full of ridiculous happy tunes with strong themes of friendship and chock full of squeaky noises and aquatic gurglings. Seems to me like they pulled it off. It's very easy to picture this as a real show now!

    Most of what you hear and see is musician/artist-conceptualized. I didn't have much of a hand in it other than the original idea. The guiding principle for working on Squiddles stuff is, any idea someone has for it automatically becomes Squiddles canon. So really anything going on here, candy corn shrimp, skipper Plumbthroat's connivings, underwater unicorns, all that came together through the collaboration of these artists while I sat quietly and boggled vacantly at their shenanigans. These guys are a bunch of nuts. But they are *your* nuts, and now their work is yours as well.

    Go buy this (*cheap!*) album and have yourself a friendship aneurysm.

    <i>Cindy Dominguez:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))

    Alright, so we did it. We decided to make a soundtrack dedicated solely to a nonexistant cartoon show about little cutesy-pie squid-things. So we told the musicians, "make this thing." Not only did they make it, they made it with 22 songs (and a short bonus track). Most of the song titles have the word "Squiddle" in them, and I'm pretty sure about 70% of the lyrics are also comprised of the word as well. It was just about the silliest project idea you could think of, but here's the thing: the musicians did a fan-squiddlin'-tastic job on this music. These are some very genuinely great songs, with the added bonus that they might also make you laugh. Win-win, right? So go give it a listen.

    Now I'm going to say a name, and I would like you to join me in giving some major props to this person for going the extra mile (beyond just making some fabulous songs) in getting this album collected, organized, prepped and mixed, as well as keeping the project on track for months (yes, this thing was a long time in the making!). Okay get ready for it here is the name: [[artist:alex-rosetti|ALEXANDER ROSETTI]]. Remember that name, and give him the biggest props you can muster for being an awesome contributor and outstanding fellow.

    Make sure you save a few props though, because I am going to be sharing another name with you in a moment.

    Let me tell you about an EXTRA SPECIAL THING. This album is not just about music. Nope, we got a bunch of spectacular artists in on the act as well, and thanks to their efforts we're including with the album an animation set to a track called (this may surprise you) "Squiddles!". It is adorable and hilarious and you can watch [a short preview of it here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100830140031/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/videos/squiddletrailer.html). The complete animation is included with the purchase of the album as an .SWF file. It was a big collaborative effort, and I'm about to mention that name I warned you about earlier: [[artist:paige-turner|PAIGE TURNER]]. All the artists contributed art of course, but this is the guy who directed and corralled everybody's efforts, did a bunch of awesome art herself (plus a puppet show!!), and put the whole animation together. Fabulous job!

    There were so many people involved in this that I went ahead and made [a separate credits page just for this album](https://web.archive.org/web/20100830161858/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/squiddles.html). Take a look and tell all these people what a great job they did by buying this ridicudorable album.

    <i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))

    The soundtrack for a cartoon show about tiny adorable fictional cephalopods. You've been waiting your entire life for this and it's *finally here.*

    <i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com "about the albums" blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110718035128/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/albums.html))

    Fake band? No, more like a real soundtrack to a fake children's cartoon show about tiny squid-like sea creatures. Fake *show,* that is, not fake children. Actually the children are fake too. It's a fake show for fake kids, but the music is real and very *good.* Get it? Then get it! The album, I mean. Get the album.

    It includes a full-length animation set to the album's title track, [which you can preview right here](https://web.archive.org/web/20110718035128/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/videos/squiddletrailer.html)!

    Lost to the sands of time! The Squiddles album. I'm not familiar with the entire history of how the art team's work went, but I do know a bit about the Squiddles album, and their association with it - which was that they made the Squiddles! cartoon intro, and wanted to do this whole, like, oh, we're going to figure out a way to make a Squiddles spinoff pilot. I wish that it'd really gone somewhere. I think we did a good job establishing the kind of, like, on the surface, you know, show for babies thing - um, that was actually secretly some... satanic eldritch horror thing. But I played it completely straight on all of my pieces for it.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>

    For the Squiddles album, I dropped in a good three tracks of fun for the whole family. "Tangled Waltz" is a little piece that [[artist:tavia-morra|Tavia]] repeatedly insists should be set to the image of a million squiddles building a castle out of little blocks. The waltz gets its name from how it gets "tangled" in the middle, turning into some kind of march in quintuple time.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> ([Michael Guy Bowman Talks About His Homestuck Music](https://youtu.be/85VXWZTg-vo?t=1275), adapted to text, 7/20/2024)

    Tangled Waltz, I think it owes itself a little to Yann Tiersen and the Amélie soundtrack, which I was listening to a lot at the time.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>

    "Squiddle Samba", after a few false starts in the writing process, ended up going this whole latin-fusion direction I rather like, complete with a guitar solo that is delightfully out of tune.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> ([Michael Guy Bowman Talks About His Homestuck Music](https://youtu.be/85VXWZTg-vo?t=1267), adapted to text, 7/20/2024)

    I really enjoyed the Squiddle Samba, that's kind of... a pastiche of Chicharia[?] or something.

    Squiddles, Squiddles, Squiddles in paradise
    Squiddles, Squiddles, let's get tangled up!
    Squiddles, Squiddles, Squiddles in paradise
    Squiddles, Squiddles, let's get tangled up!

    Squiddles down in paradise invite you to play
    They're tangled up with joy and fun every single day
    It's a silly kind of life they live, but for them it's nothing new
    They are friends with everyone and they love you!

    'Cause they're Squiddles, Squiddles, Squiddles in paradise
    Squiddles, Squiddles, let's get tangled up!

    It's a funny time in paradise with their Squiddle friends and more
    So let's dive on in and we'll go see what they have in store
    We'll ride up on sea unicorns into uncharted lands
    Watch out for Skipper Plumbthroat! And his salty band
    (Bye Skipper Plumbthroat!) (I'll get you yet!)

    They're Squiddles, Squiddles, Squiddles in paradise
    Squiddles, Squiddles, let's get tangled up!

    It's a lovely time in paradise, see the Squiddles smile with glee
    We should join them in the fun they made for you and me
    'Cause soon enough we'll have to leave, and depart for shore
    But we'll be back another day, on the ocean floor!

    Squiddles, Squiddles, Squiddles in paradise
    Squiddles, Squiddles, let's get tangled up!
    Squiddles, Squiddles, Squiddles in paradise
    Squiddles, Squiddles, let's get tangled up!
    Squiddles, Squiddles, Squiddles in paradise
    Squiddles, Squiddles, let's get tangled up!

Commentary: |-
    <i>Solatrus:</i> (original commentary)

    Haha, oh man.

    My vocal debut, and what is it? Me mocking the music kids shows. It's an adorable song, though.

    Okay, so this one actually has a bit of history, quite a long time before Homestuck. I've been at this music thing for over 9 years after all.

    Originally I was interested in writing a sort of uplifting and mellow hip hop song, and the first thing I did was make an organ synth with a swung version of one of the melodies you hear in Squiddles in Paradise. I was actually working with AndrewNeo (him again!) on the song.

    Of course, that never panned out, but when I finally felt like I should contribute to the Squiddles album (I was among the last to actually start something) all those years later, I remembered that melody.

    And then Alex told me the whole hip hop feel, even though it was pretty relaxing, just wasn't gonna work. So I reworked it into a pretty cheesy and stereotypical reggae song and just stopped caring altogether about how it sounded. I mean, come on, it's a freaking parody album!

    Eventually Alex recorded some Squiddle vocals for it because I thought it'd be hilarious, and he sang (badly out of tune on purpose) the chorus. I thought it was brilliant and promptly wrote a full set of lyrics.

    TLDR, the chorus to Squiddles in Paradise was actually made up by Alex Rosetti basically on accident, and the song was originally some hip hop song I did over half a decade ago.

    <i>Solatrus:</i> ([Tumblr](https://thisisthehomestuckmusicteam.tumblr.com/post/27234067507/solatrus-squiddles-in-paradise-well-what-do))

    Well, what do you know, my vocal debut?

    This song has a remarkably old history to it, elements of it dating back to 2005, not too long after I started using FL Studio. Originally this was a sort of uplifting hip-hop song that I did in collaboration with AndrewNeo, but the song was never finished. I'd share the song with you, but unfortunately I don't have the plugins I used because back then I didn't care as much about pirating VSTs and the like.

    Anyway, while this song is chronologically my second official Homestuck song, it's also the second song I wrote after joining the team. The first song I wrote after joining will be discussed next time. Hehe.

    Nonetheless, <i>do</i> have a little snippet ([dead link](http://www.solatrus.com/static/music/misc/Squiddlesofsomesort.mp3)) of what I did with that hip-hop song when the Squiddles album was starting up, which is not too different from the original, aside from a more interesting beat and bassline.

    I sent it over to Alex Rosetti, but we ended up agreeing that going with the hip-hop style. Even though it was a pretty relaxing song, it wasn't going to be a good fit for what Alex had in mind for the album.

    Thus, I scrapped it and started to work on other songs before coming back to it almost a month later.

    It hit me one day that I should try rewriting the song in a <b>really</b> ridiculous, cheesy, and cliche reggae style, and completely not care. So I did.

    I again sent this to Alex and he really liked it, and he quickly recorded some Squiddles very horribly singing what eventually became the chorus. I thought it was brilliant and was immediately inspired to write lyrics for the entire song, which really helped flesh out everything. It also let me use [[group:toby-fox|Radiation's]] hilarious Skipper Plumbthroat voice briefly, though that went uncredited in the song, hah!

    And after some work, I arrived to the final song that's on the Squiddles album.

    <b>Other Thoughts</b>

    [[artist:michael-guy-bowman|Michael Bowman]] once mentioned that <i>Squiddles in Paradise</i> is one of the few songs on the album that really balances the act between a legitimate song and a downright silly song. I was pretty flattered when both said this and when he recommended this song ([dead link](https://iambowman.tumblr.com/post/13659731094/im-rounding-out-my-homestuck-album-collection-and-im)), among others from the album, to a fan.

    I actually have to agree with Bowman after looking back at it almost two years later. Despite how little effort I feel that I put into this song, it was a really fun and silly song to write... about kid-friendly horrorterrors... in paradise.

Lyrics: |-
    They call me Skipper Plumbthroat
    'Tis a name ye'd best remember (Yar)
    I'm captain of me ol' boat
    The Grundy Catchyegrabber (Oh-ho)

    I travel the seven seas
    In search of valuable ink
    It sparkles like a blessing
    Of unicorns made from zinc

    I'll row, row, row me boat
    Collect that valuable prize
    I need the stuff to stay afloat
    'Tis the apple of me eyes

    This ink that I do seek
    Comes from little Squiddles
    They swim around and squeak
    And are full of Squiddle giggles

    My fishing nets will grab
    A tentacle or two
    And maybe afterwards
    I'll have some Squiddle Stew!

    Row, row, row me boat
    An' throw out all o' me nets
    Those squids won't know what hit 'em
    'Til they're payin' off me debts

    (Yes... if I... if I ever can pay off me debts, I mean, I... I still have to pay for... school. My... I mean... just- never mind, never mind! Just, well...)

    Sometimes I have to ask meself
    Skipper, where's your life led ya?
    You dropped right out of law school
    To sell rutabagas (I need a tangle buddy.)

    My poor business flopped
    I was penniless once more
    So land for sea I swapped
    And left my native shore

    Strugglin' to stay afloat
    But it's all right, I guess
    Just as long as I can gloat
    An' sail an' fish an' Aggress

    (Aggress. I love aggressin'. Yar, har. Ah-har. Yar-har!)

    I've come far, that's for sure
    Nanna Plumbthroat would be proud (Yes, she would.)
    I've no time to be demure
    'Cause I'm scary as a storm cloud (Or scarier!)

    Yar-har
    The fishin' life's for me
    I love me job, I love me life
    Catching Squiddles of the sea!

    (Yar-har-har. I'll get those little Squiddles yet. If I can... if I can just get enough money, and... maybe overcome my crippling depression. But... but I have friends, I have a crew! They... they like me and, but... well... I mean...)

Lyrics: |-
    (Mister Bowman, can you tell us about the Squiddles?)
    (Well of course, child!)
    (Yay!)

    Let me tell you of the Squiddles who live below the sea
    They love to sing and dance and play just like you and me
    They're squishy little creatures with tentacles of joy
    And adorable eyes that bring delight to every girl and boy

    Not much is known about the Squiddles, at least on our behalf
    And many wonder why it is they always seem to laugh
    Do they know some kind of secret? Well, maybe, just in part
    But any child knows the real answer deep within their heart!

    They laugh because they love
    They sing because they're free
    They splash because they're safe and sound
    Below the deep blue sea

    They leap because they like you
    They swim because they're swell
    They smile because they have so many
    Stories they like to tell

    The Squiddles live in a magical land
    Below the waves in castles of sand
    If you listen close you can hear them make their plans

    (What kind of plans?)
    (Happy Squiddle plans!)

    They kiss because they can't help it
    They wiggle because why not!
    They prance because they're oh so proud
    Of all the friends they've got (Hey guys, how's it going?)

    They jump because they're joyful
    They giggle because they're glad
    They Squiddle because in Squiddle Land
    No one's ever sad!

    (All right, now we're going to do the whole song one more time, and this time I want everybody to join in. Parents, that means you too. If you don't know the words just look them up online, I'm sure they're there somewhere. Otherwise, sit real close to your television set and follow the bouncing ball and you're sure to be a winner! Are you ready, kids? All right, here it comes again. And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three!)

    They laugh because they love
    They sing because they're free
    They splash because they're safe and sound
    Below the deep blue sea

    They leap because they like you
    They swim because they're swell
    They smile because they have so many
    Stories they like to tell

    The Squiddles live in a magical land
    Below the waves in castles of sand
    If you listen close you can hear them make their plans

    (What sort of plans?)
    (Happy Squiddle plans!)

    They kiss because they can't help it
    They wiggle because why not
    They prance because they're oh so proud
    Of all the friends they've got

    They jump because they're joyful
    They giggle because they're glad
    They Squiddle because in Squiddle Land
    No one's ever sad!

    "Mister Bowman Tells You About the Squiddles" is maybe 50% Donovan and 50% pure evil, although you wouldn't know it considering I ended up cutting a set of alternate lyrics that would have been more sadistic than the album's bizarre conclusion. Tavia gets her cameo as the little girl and some of the backup Squiddle voices.

    There's also Mister Bowman Tells You About the Squiddles, where I dared self-insert into the comic, as myself, doing vocals *again.* I wanted there to be, like, some creepy verses that were, um, "they laugh because they love, they swim because they're swell, they smile because they have no sense of heaven or of hell." I think that direction might have been funny, but... I was just playing it completely straight, I turned it into something I could take to conventions and like, just perform and have people actually sing along to. And you know, just, Captain Kangaroo style or whatever, everyone just becomes little kids singing along, y'know!

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i>

    Everyone writing songs for the Squiddles album opted for happy-go-lucky and crazy-sounding things, but in an effort to make a variety, I aimed instead for something more calm and serene, picturing a calm ocean at night lit only by the full moon and stars. Admittedly, it's just 12 bars that repeat over and over, each time adding in an additional instrument track. Still, it's one of the most relaxing things I've ever written.

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i> ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFWWC9vmSzQ&lc=Ugy-xyqLnKP3Dh7NgfR4AaABAg))

    I don't think I ever mentioned this to anyone before, but this song is based after, of all things, a tune I wrote in the background of one of my custom WarioWare D.I.Y. minigames.  The two bars from 1:21 to 1:25 is almost exactly how it sounded in that game, except more MIDI-like.

    (The minigame itself had nothing to do with Homestuck or Squiddles; it was a game where you see a pair of eyes in the darkness, and you had to stop a moving bar in the right spot to turn on a light bulb and reveal a black cat.)

Lyrics: |-
    Squiddles are not ordinary friends
    They work and play and work again
    But they have homes and mommies too
    Yes, they have mommies just like you

    So let them go to bed right now
    So they can rest and make cute sounds
    Because if they don't, they won't be strong (If they can't rest they won't be strong)
    And they're so small, they won't last long (Well, they are really tiny)

    And Plumbthroat's fishing boat (Plumbthroat's fishing boat)
    Woah-oh oh-oh (Is gonna kill the Squiddles if they don't get any sleep)
    So let them go to sleep
    (So let them sleep)

    ('Cause they will die if they don't get to sleep) Let them go to sleep
    (Plumbthroat has a thing for killing insomniac jellyfish) Tangle Buddies, Tangle Buddies, Tangle Buddies, Tangle Buddies, Tangle Buddies, Tangle Buddies
    (It's not a pretty sight) Oh, the Tangle Buddies in the Tangle Buddies going out to sea
    (Let's go to Brineswallow)
    Going to Brineswallow now, Brineswallow now
    Brineswallow (Brineswallow)
    Brineswallow (Brineswallow)
    Yeah (Brineswallow)
    Yeah, yeah, kill the world (Let's all go on an adventure)

    Squeedle dee dee
    Squeedle dee dum
    Everyone sing a Squiddly song
    Let's all be friends
    And work as a team
    Squiddles for you
    Squiddles for me!

    Tangle Buddies
    Let's become
    Tangle Buddies
    That's right
    Tangle Buddies
    You heard me
    Tangle Buddies
    Tangle Buddies
    Let's become
    Tangle Buddies
    That's right
    Tangle Buddies
    You heard me
    Tangle Bu—

    Let's become Tangle Buddies
    Tangle Buddies
    Let's become Tangle Buddies...
