    <b>THIS IS INCREDIBLY SILLY</b><br>
    Hey guys, guess what the next album is all about! No, your guess is wrong. It is a Squiddles album. Surprise!

    Here is an important thing to note before all else. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD9DO7P2vbU">This album comes with a full-length animation!</a>

    A lot of the same people who have contributed to MSPA animations lately worked on that animation. In fact, they did 100% of it! Conceptualized it and storyboarded it and drew all the assets, all under the supervision of a very skilled Flash animator named [[artist:paige-turner|Paige Turner]].

    This album began percolating many months ago, and as with much of what this music fellowship works on, it snowballed in quantity and silliness and awesomeness over an extended period of time. It began with [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alex Rosetti's]] great [[track:squiddles|single track]], a snippet of which found its way into the big [[flash:1940|[S] Descend]] mashup.

    The idea we formed around that song was to make an album that would serve as the soundtrack for a fictional cartoon show for kids, full of ridiculous happy tunes with strong themes of friendship and chock full of squeaky noises and aquatic gurglings. Seems to me like they pulled it off. It's very easy to picture this as a real show now!

    Most of what you hear and see is musician/artist-conceptualized. I didn't have much of a hand in it other than the original idea. The guiding principle for working on Squiddles stuff is, any idea someone has for it automatically becomes Squiddles canon. So really anything going on here, candy corn shrimp, skipper Plumbthroat's connivings, underwater unicorns, all that came together through the collaboration of these artists while I sat quietly and boggled vacantly at their shenanigans. These guys are a bunch of nuts. But they are your nuts, and now their work is yours as well.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    For the Squiddles album, I dropped in a good three tracks of fun for the whole family. "Tangled Waltz" is a little piece that [[artist:tavia-morra|Tavia]] repeatedly insists should be set to the image of a million squiddles building a castle out of little blocks. The waltz gets its name from how it gets "tangled" in the middle, turning into some kind of march in quintuple time.

    It's a funny time in paradise with their Squiddle friends and more<br>So let's dive on in and we'll go see what they have in store<br>We'll ride up on sea unicorns into uncharted lands<br>Watch out for Skipper Plumbthroat! And his salty band<br>(Bye Skipper Plumbthroat!) (I'll catch you yet!)
    They're Squiddles, Squiddles, Squiddles in paradise<br>Squiddles, Squiddles, let's get tangled up!
    It's a lovely time in paradise, see the Squiddles smile with glee<br>We should join them in the fun they made for you and me<br>'Cause soon enough we'll have to leave, and depart for shore<br>But we'll be back another day, on the ocean floor!

    <i>Solatrus:</i>
    <i>(original commentary)</i>
    Haha, oh man.
    My vocal debut, and what is it? Me mocking the music kids shows. Itâ€™s an adorable song, though.
    Okay, so this one actually has a bit of history, quite a long time before Homestuck. Iâ€™ve been at this music thing for over 9 years after all.
    Originally I was interested in writing a sort of uplifting and mellow hip hop song, and the first thing I did was make an organ synth with a swung version of one of the melodies you hear in Squiddles in Paradise. I was actually working with AndrewNeo (him again!) on the song.
    Of course, that never panned out, but when I finally felt like I should contribute to the Squiddles album (I was among the last to actually start something) all those years later, I remembered that melody.
    And then Alex told me the whole hip hop feel, even though it was pretty relaxing, just wasnâ€™t gonna work. So I reworked it into a pretty cheesy and stereotypical reggae song and just stopped caring altogether about how it sounded. I mean, come on, itâ€™s a freaking parody album!
    Eventually Alex recorded some Squiddle vocals for it because I thought itâ€™d be hilarious, and he sang (badly out of tune on purpose) the chorus. I thought it was brilliant and promptly wrote a full set of lyrics.
    TLDR, the chorus to Squiddles in Paradise was actually made up by Alex Rosetti basically on accident, and the song was originally some hip hop song I did over half a decade ago.
    <i>(commentary redux)</i>
    Well, what do you know, my vocal debut?
    This song has a remarkably old history to it, elements of it dating back to 2005, not too long after I started using FL Studio. Originally this was a sort of uplifting hip-hop song that I did in collaboration with AndrewNeo, but the song was never finished. Iâ€™d share the song with you, but unfortunately I donâ€™t have the plugins I used because back then I didnâ€™t care as much about pirating VSTs and the like.
    Anyway, while this song is chronologically my second official Homestuck song, itâ€™s also the second song I wrote after joining the team. The first song I wrote after joining will be discussed next time. Hehe.
    Nonetheless, do have a little snippet of what I did with that hip-hop song when the Squiddles album was starting up, which is not too different from the original, aside from a more interesting beat and bassline. (<a href="http://www.solatrus.com/static/music/misc/Squiddlesofsomesort.mp3">dead link</a>)
    I sent it over to Alex Rosetti, but we ended up agreeing that going with the hip-hop style. Even though it was a pretty relaxing song, it wasnâ€™t going to be a good fit for what Alex had in mind for the album.
    Thus, I scrapped it and started to work on other songs before coming back to it almost a month later.
    It hit me one day that I should try rewriting the song in a really ridiculous, cheesy, and cliche reggae style, and completely not care. So I did.
    I again sent this to Alex and he really liked it, and he quickly recorded some Squiddles very horribly singing what eventually became the chorus. I thought it was brilliant and was immediately inspired to write lyrics for the entire song, which really helped flesh out everything. It also let me use Radiationâ€™s hilarious Skipper Plumbthroat voice briefly, though that went uncredited in the song, hah!
    And after some work, I arrived to the final song thatâ€™s on the Squiddles album.
    <b>Other Thoughts</b>
    Michael Bowman once mentioned that Squiddles in Paradise is one of the few songs on the album that really balances the act between a legitimate song and a downright silly song. I was pretty flattered when both said this and when he recommended this song, among others from the album, to a fan.
    I actually have to agree with Bowman after looking back at it almost two years later. Despite how little effort I feel that I put into this song, it was a really fun and silly song to writeâ€¦ about kid-friendly horrorterrorsâ€¦ in paradise.

Lyrics: |-
    They call me Skipper Plumbthroat<br>'Tis a name ye'd best remember (Yar)<br>I'm captain of me ol' boat<br>The Grundy Catchyegrabber (Oh-ho)
    I travel the seven seas<br>In search of valuable ink<br>It sparkles like a blessing<br>Of unicorns made from zinc
    I'll row, row, row me boat<br>Collect that valuable prize<br>I need the stuff to stay afloat<br>'Tis the apple of me eyes
    This ink that I do seek<br>Comes from little Squiddles<br>They swim around and squeak<br>And are full of Squiddle giggles
    My fishing nets will grab<br>A tentacle or two<br>And maybe afterwards<br>I'll have some Squiddle Stew!
    Row, row, row me boat<br>An' throw out all o' me nets<br>Those squids won't know what hit 'em<br>â€˜Til they're payin' off me debts
    (Yes... if I... if I ever can pay off me debts, I mean, I... I still have to pay for... school. My... I mean... just- never mind, never mind! Just, well...)
    Sometimes I have to ask meself<br>Skipper, where's your life led ya?<br>You dropped right out of law school<br>To sell rutabagas (I need a tangle buddy.)
    My poor business flopped<br>I was penniless once more<br>So land for sea I swapped<br>And left my native shore
    Strugglin' to stay afloat<br>But it's all right, I guess<br>Just as long as I can gloat<br>An' sail an' fish an' Aggress
    (Aggress. I love aggressin'. Yar, har. Ah-har. Yar-har!)
    I've come far, that's for sure<br>Nanna Plumbthroat would be proud (Yes, she would.)<br>I've no time to be demure<br>â€˜Cause I'm scary as a storm cloud (Or scarier!)
    Yar-har<br>The fishin' life's for me<br>I love me job, I love me life<br>Catching Squiddles of the sea!
    (Yar-har-har. Iâ€™ll get those little Squiddles yet. If I can... if I can just get enough money, and... maybe overcome my crippling depression. But... but I have friends, I have a crew! They... they like me and, but... well... I mean...)

    (Mister Bowman, can you tell us about the Squiddles?)<br>(Well of course, child!)<br>(Yay!)
    Let me tell you of the Squiddles who live below the sea<br>They love to sing and dance and play just like you and me<br>They're squishy little creatures with tentacles of joy<br>And adorable eyes that bring delight to every girl and boy
    Not much is known about the Squiddles, at least on our behalf<br>And many wonder why it is they always seem to laugh<br>Do they know some kind of secret? Well, maybe, just in part<br>But any child knows the real answer deep within their heart!
    They laugh because they love<br>They sing because they're free<br>They splash because they're safe and sound<br>Below the deep blue sea
    They leap because they like you<br>They swim because they're swell<br>They smile because they have so many<br>Stories they like to tell
    The Squiddles live in a magical land<br>Below the waves in castles of sand<br>If you listen close you can hear them make their plans
    (What kind of plans?)<br>(Happy Squiddle plans!)
    They kiss because they can't help it<br>They wiggle because why not!<br>They prance because they're oh so proud<br>Of all the friends they've got (Hey guys, how's it going?)
    They jump because they're joyful<br>They giggle because they're glad<br>They Squiddle because in Squiddle Land<br>No one's ever sad!
    (All right, now we're going to do the whole song one more time, and this time I want everybody to join in. Parents, that means you too. If you don't know the words just look them up online, I'm sure they're there somewhere. Otherwise, sit real close to your television set and follow the bouncing ball and you're sure to be a winner! Are you ready, kids? All right, here it comes again. And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three!)
    They laugh because they love<br>They sing because they're free<br>They splash because they're safe and sound<br>Below the deep blue sea
    They leap because they like you<br>They swim because they're swell<br>They smile because they have so many<br>Stories they like to tell

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    "Mister Bowman Tells You About the Squiddles" is maybe 50% Donovan and 50% pure evil, although you wouldn't know it considering I ended up cutting a set of alternate lyrics that would have been more sadistic than the album's bizarre conclusion. Tavia gets her cameo as the little girl and some of the backup Squiddle voices.

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i>
    Everyone writing songs for the Squiddles album opted for happy-go-lucky and crazy-sounding things, but in an effort to make a variety, I aimed instead for something more calm and serene, picturing a calm ocean at night lit only by the full moon and stars. Admittedly, it's just 12 bars that repeat over and over, each time adding in an additional instrument track. Still, it's one of the most relaxing things I've ever written.
