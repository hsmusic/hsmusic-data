    This is the soundtrack for the Homestuck fangame [Hammerkind](http://web.archive.org/web/20130217073716/http://www.cloudcovergames.net/hammerkind/). It was composed by Stephen Maxwell, who made the game under the Cloud Cover Games label.
    Due to a lack of a proper soundtrack release, the album is hosted on YouTube and Archive.org. Additionally, the author was only able to recover four tracks, so [[Forgery]] and [[Beat the Game]] are recorded from the game itself (yes, I probably had to be the first person in a decade to beat all the levels and unlock all the secrets).

  <i>Stephen Maxwell:</i>
  [[track:guardian|"GUARDIAN"]] by [[artist:bill-bolin|BILL BOLIN]] (since removed from MSPA canon due to DRAMA) has been senselessly mutilated in order to make "IMPOCALYPSE".

  This track plays during the IMPOCALYPSE game mode, which is a survival mode where you fight off waves of enemies.

    [[track:skies-of-skaia|"SKIES OF SKAIA"]] by [[artist:mark-j-hadley|MARK HADLEY]] and [[track:upward-movement-dave-owns|"UPWARD MOVEMENT"]] by [[artist:kalibration|KALIBRATION]] were unsubtly crammed together to create "STAIRS TO SKAIA".
    <i>Makin:</i> (wiki editor)
    This track plays during the main game mode STAIRS TO SKAIA, where you ascend/build past all the gates and fight imps to reach Skaia.

  [[track:explore|"EXPLORE"]] by [[artist:buzinkai|BUZINKAI]] was disrespected by the amateur duplication called "EXPLODE".

  [[track:beatdown-strider-style|"BEATDOWN"]] by [[artist:curt-blakeslee|CURT BLAKESLEE]] and [[track:showtime-original-mix|"SHOWTIME"]] by [[artist:malcolm-brown|MALCOLM BROWN]] see hasty remixes in the track "BEAT THE GAME".

  As the track title implies, this plays when you beat any of the game's modes.
