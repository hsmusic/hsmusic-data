    This is the soundtrack for the Homestuck fangame [Hammerkind](https://web.archive.org/web/20130217073716/http://www.cloudcovergames.net/hammerkind/). It was composed by Stephen Maxwell, who made the game under the Cloud Cover Games label.

    Due to a lack of a proper soundtrack release, the album is hosted on YouTube and Archive.org. Additionally, the author was only able to recover four tracks, so [[Forgery]] and [[Beat the Game]] are recorded from the game itself (yes, I probably had to be the first person in a decade to beat all the levels and unlock all the secrets).

    The MENU TUNE called "BEAGLE AEGIS" was also generally inspired by all the great work crafted by the MSPA MUSIC TEAM and WHAT PUMPKIN.

    Menu song (based on a background part of the main theme, so you can't really recognize any parts of Homestuck songs)

    [[track:guardian|"GUARDIAN"]] by [[artist:bill-bolin|BILL BOLIN]] (since removed from MSPA canon due to DRAMA) has been senselessly mutilated in order to make "IMPOCALYPSE".

    Impocalypse (based on [[track:guardian|Guardian]]. This one is a little messy, but it has its moments.)

    <i>Makin:</i> (wiki editor)

    This track plays during the IMPOCALYPSE game mode, which is a survival mode where you fight off waves of enemies.

    [[track:skies-of-skaia|"SKIES OF SKAIA"]] by [[artist:mark-j-hadley|MARK HADLEY]] and [[track:upward-movement-dave-owns|"UPWARD MOVEMENT"]] by [[artist:kalibration|KALIBRATION]] were unsubtly crammed together to create "STAIRS TO SKAIA".

    Hammerkind main theme (based on [[track:upward-movement-dave-owns|Dave Fucking Owns/Upward Movement]] and [[track:skies-of-skaia|Skies of Skaia]]. This version, used in the game, is kind of a cross between the two I already posted in this thread, with a few other minor changes.)

    <i>Makin:</i> (wiki editor)

    This track plays during the main game mode STAIRS TO SKAIA, where you ascend/build past all the gates and fight imps to reach Skaia.

    [[track:explore|"EXPLORE"]] by [[artist:buzinkai|BUZINKAI]] was disrespected by the amateur duplication called "EXPLODE".

    Explode (Candy) (based on [[track:explore|Explore]])

    <i>Makin:</i> (wiki editor)

    This is the final boss theme of the main game mode, where you fight Trickster John Egbert.

    [[track:chorale-for-jaspers|"CHORALE FOR JASPERS"]] by [[artist:michael-guy-bowman|MICHAEL GUY BOWMAN]] was twisted into "FORGERY".

    [[track:beatdown-strider-style|"BEATDOWN"]] by [[artist:curt-blakeslee|CURT BLAKESLEE]] and [[track:showtime-original-mix|"SHOWTIME"]] by [[artist:malcolm-brown|MALCOLM BROWN]] see hasty remixes in the track "BEAT THE GAME".

    <i>Makin:</i> (wiki editor)

    As the track title implies, this plays when you beat any of the game's modes.
