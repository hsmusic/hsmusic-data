    (When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you, they're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are— Great Dinner.)

    It all could happen...

    Put your hands together, if you want to clap
    As we take you through, this monkey rap!

    Mayor, mayor, ma mayor mayor!

Lyrics: |-
    Look
    If you had one shot or one opportunity
    To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
    Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

    His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
    There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
    To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
    What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
    He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
    He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
    The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
    Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
    There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
    Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
    His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
    He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
    When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
    Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
    Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better

    His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
    This world is mine for the taking, make me king
    As we move toward a New World Order
    A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
    Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
    Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
    These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
    He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
    God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
    He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
    But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
    These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
    They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
    He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
    Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
    But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better

    No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
    Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
    I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
    I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
    But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
    Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
    All the pain inside amplified by the
    Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
    Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
    'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
    And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
    And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
    Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
    Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
    Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
    Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
    Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
    To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
    Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
    Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
    To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
    So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
    This may be the only opportunity that I got

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better...

    You can do anything you set your mind to, man
    Mom's Spaghetti-ghetti
    Ghe-ghe-ghetti
    Ghe-ghe-ghetti
    (Ghe-ghe-ghe-ghe-ghe-ghe-ghetti...)

    (THE PLACE WAS GENSOKYO, THE YEAR WAS 19720)

    I'm thinking of a number that is between my buttocks
    And that number's not between 450 and 850
    With nothing but greed capturing my heart
    Will no one just go reach inside, cast away my bad score

    Missing and unfound, undefined fantastic score
    Can't reach this debtful soul, my subterranean fruity pebble
    Seven hundred twenty desires denied by
    The embodiment of the demonic Stutzbow

    Reptile masquerade from the one debts left unpaid
    An impossible ball catch, one hundred percent delayed
    An immaterial coat missing on this freezing soul
    The imperishable rice challenging my sinful hopes
    I must keep escaping far from this perfect blosssomed yard
    Its phantasmagoric view of penumbral small white hounds
    Scarlet rhapsody police, running rotten to the core
    I won't let them or the Stutzbow destroy my credit score

    Bumper to bumper I flee, from the brothers that believe
    That my sinful soul can solve the pasta's antinomy
    Through idioms japanese, untranslatable I feel
    The Stutzbow will never stop, chasing me with endless glee
    Meme numbers won't appear, not a miracle, just fright
    As I near my final fate, my endless numeric night
    Texas history forlorn, in limbo its long lost lore
    In this realm never forgiven, not my bad credit score

    I'm thinking of a number that is between my buttocks
    And that number's not between 450 and 850
    With nothing but greed capturing my heart
    Will no one just go reach inside, cast away my bad score

    Missing and unfound, undefined fantastic score
    Can't reach this debtful soul, my subterranean fruity pebble
    Seven hundred twenty desires denied by
    the embodiment of the demonic Stutzbow

    Reptile masquerade from the one debts left unpaid
    An impossible ball catch, one hundred percent delayed
    An immaterial coat missing on this freezing soul
    The imperishable rice challenging my sinful hopes
    I must keep escaping far from this perfect blosssomed yard
    Its phantasmagoric view of penumbral small white hounds
    Scarlet rhapsody police, running rotten to the core
    I won't let them or the Stutzbow destroy my credit score

    Life insurance I can't pay, or a good bed to hide in
    Is there no place to run to, a safe haven for my sins
    Desperation swallows me, I feel wholly unprepared
    From the Bowman I can't flee, from the Stutzman mercy's rare
    Soon the brothers will catch up, meat cubes rising in the night
    Their goal easy to discern, start an unwinnable fight
    My bad credit and my life, forfeit to their endless war
    A war started with a thought, thinking of a credit score

    (Trainscriber's note: you like Huey Lewis and the News? Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.)
