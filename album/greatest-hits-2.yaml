Lyrics: |-
    It's the—
    OH MY GO-O-O-OOOOD
    OH MY GOD MY GOOOOOD

    (Fool me once.) (Are you kidding me?) (Fool me twice.) [unintelligible] (Fool me three times - You're officially that guy, okay? You know him, you know the one. You go to the bar and he's like, 'This suit is, uh, officially it's a Giorgio Armani, ech my dad knows him!' Fuck you!) (Oh, nigga!)

    OLÉ!

    GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!
    GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!

    [Animal Crossing noises]

    C'mon it's time to get hyped say whoop! (There it is!)
    C'mon all the fellas say whoop! (There it is!)
    C'mon one time for the ladies say whoop! (There it is!)
    Now all the fellas say whoop! (There it is!)

    So they're finally here, performing for you
    If you know the words, you can join in too
    Put your hands together, if you want to clap
    As we take you through, this monkey rap!

    Mayor, mayor, ma mayor mayor!
    Mayor, mayor, ma mayor mayor!
    Mayor, mayor, ma mayor mayor!
    Mayor, mayor, ma mayor mayor!

    When the pimp's in the crib, ma
    Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
    When the pigs try to get at you
    Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot

    Interior crocodile alligator
    I drive a Chevrolet movie theater

    Big dirty stinking bass
    Dirty stinking bass
    Big dirty stinking bass bass bass bass

    X gon' give it to ya (What?)
    Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya (Uh)
    Knock-knock, open up the door, it's real
    With the non-stop pop-pop from stainless steel
    Go hard, gettin' busy with it (Ooh)
    But I got such a good heart that I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it (Yeah)

    (READY? GO!)

    (PLAYER THREE: DEFEATED!)
    (SHARE STOCK!)

    La-da-da-da-dah
    It's the motherfuckin' D-O-double-G (Snoop Dogg!)
    La-da-da-da-dah
    It's one and only D-O-double-G (Snoop Dogg!)

    [screaming]

    BACK, YARD, FUN!

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe
    So, come on, and let's go!
