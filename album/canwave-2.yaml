Lyrics: |-
    (The year is 2020. President Trump has led our nation into one of the worst econonic recessions in the history of the Earth. Imigrants are pouring through the southern border. Just look at that chaos! If you thought the econony was bad with Obana in charge, think again! And not only has Trump destroyed the country, but he's running for re-election! His challenger? Representative Cory Booker from New Jersey. It's up to the intrepid Jhon Ebgret to make his way to the White House and assassinate the president, evil Trump, so that he can finally have Cory in the House! Is he a bad enough dude to off the President of the United States himself? Don't turn that dial! It's... CANWAVE TWOOOOOO!)

Lyrics: |-
    I wanted so much more
    Than a game we were born to lose
    I wanted so much more

    Things fall apart so easily
    They break away at the seams
    And it seems
    This is the life I was fated to lead
    Dreams dead in the water
    And you ought to let them pass

    So many things I wanted to do
    So many dreams
    Left for dead in the water
    Drowned and gone, just smile and let them go

Lyrics: |-
    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Well come on, get ready, get set, and here we go

    The Ga-

    GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    Uh!
    Do it, do it, do it, do it!
    Uh!
    Do it, do it, do it, do it!
    Alright!

    (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go GameBro)
    (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go GameBro)

    Uh!
    Do it, do it, do it, do it!
    Uh!
    Alright!

Lyrics: |-
    When the low, heavy sky weighs like a lid
    On the spirit aching for the light
    And when, embracing the horizon
    It pours on us a black day which is sadder than any night

    When the earth is turned into a dripping dungeon
    In which Hope, like a bat, flutters blindly
    And bruises its timid wing and tender head
    Against the walls and rotted ceilings

    When the rain, stretching down its long streaks of water
    Imitates the bars of an enormous prison
    And a silent throng of loathsome spiders come
    And weave their webs inside our brains

    Then suddenly, the bells swing angrily
    And hurl their hideous uproar into the sky
    Like a band of wandering spirits...

Commentary: |-
    <i>Makin:</i> (Perplexed)
    This is a nightcore remix (speed-up) of a vaporwave remix (slow-down) of [[track:xrom]] by Toby Fox. Does it reference the original song, or does it reference the vaporwave remix? To sample, or not to sample, that is the question.
    I guess I'll just write the most stupid interpretation in.

    [reversed]
    So many things I wanted to do
    So many dreams
    Left for dead in the water
    Drowned and gone, just smile and let them go

    Things fall apart so easily
    They break away at the seams
    And it seems
    This is the life I was fated to lead
    Dreams dead in the water
    And you ought to let them pass

    So many things I wanted to do
    So many dreams
    Left for dead in the water
    Drowned and gone, just smile and let them go

    But it seems that's all I'm gonna get
    It's best to forget

Lyrics: |-
    One bright summer morning, in mid-to-late June
    Our president Trump was holding a spoon
    He was eating a soup at the great dinner table
    With his fair wife Melania and his sons Cain and Abel
    Who these two children were was a mystery to them all
    They'd just shown up one day and proceeded to call
    The Trump couple their parents, though odd, yes, it seems
    Their coming was foreshadowed by one of Trump's dreams

    My dear children, Trump said, with a saccharine grin
    You seem to be getting uncommonly thin
    Please eat up your soup so your muscles get yuge
    I don't want to resort to any food subterfuge

    I don't want to eat soup
    Cain replied with great force
    I'd rather eat chocolate please, make it three-course

    How rude of a thing to demand, I must say
    Said our dear Donald Trump, though he gave the okay
    And when Cain was quite finished with stuffing his face
    He and Abel returned to their planet in space
    Once Melania had retired to her chamber upstairs
    Donald rapped on the wall in a pattern of squares
    A door opened up to a room filled with toys
    Though not ones that you'd give to small girls or small boys)
    On a bed in the center lay one young Toby Fox
    He looked up from his book and he tossed back his locks

    Hello my dear Donald, how was dinner today?
    Not great, I confess, though I do have to say
    Cain's aversion to food that would improve his health
    Is disturbing to me, it's a symptom of wealth

    That's very astute of you, Donald, dear sir
    I most definitely agree. I approve. I concur
    Now come take a seat here, next to me on our bed
    I'll make you feel better by giving you head

    But before Trump could take a step forward, just then
    A young boy with a rabbit interrupted their zen
    As he entered the room and he pointed at Trump
    I'm redy to figt, you plump grumpy lump

    Oh god, Andrew Hussie, what have you created?
    O's gone much too far with his SBAHJ lust unsated
    Now listen up Jhon, if you want to hurt Don
    You must go through me first, come at me, you prawn

    (Awww yeah. This is what people do before raps right? S L A B.)

    Yo my name's Toby Fox, please don't call me Radiation
    I created the nutshack and I made up Snow Halation
    I'll clear one thing up now—I'm not o, I'm his ex
    But now Trump's the only person with whom I'll have sex
    I've dedicated my life to creating awesome tunes
    My OST is better than Earthbound's, and Rollercoaster Tycoon's
    Andrew's Hussie's little Hiveswap is nothing to my two games
    But first Undertale, then its sequel, set my world into flames
    I shed blood, sweat, and tears to make it out of depression
    And now I come back to my lover's recession?
    Donald, baby, I still love you, but a great depression, jeez
    Anyway, I need some cash so buy my games please

    (Still going. [unintelligible])

    Now whether you're gay, bi, pan, libertarian, or straight
    you should buy my games cause the shipping's downright great
    And if you feel left out by my statement there
    Uh, you should buy them anyway, damn,I really love Flare.
    So yeah, I guess that's me and I'm done with this rap
    I think I flowed pretty well though my transitions were crap
    I'd also like to say.. uh, let's fight, come on
    I won't let anyone hurt my boyfriend, least of all a SBAHJ-y John
    (That line is still so fucking hard to say.)

    (Yaeh, ok.)
    Jhon brandished his bunny at Toby, his face
    As neutral as ever, as if stuck in place
    And Toby, his face pale as pale could be
    Remarked
    I have to use the toilet.. uhh brb!

    Then Jhon turned to Trump, his intentions made clear
    Trump's skin was beet red, and his eyes filled with fear
    Jhon pulled out a space gun and covered his eyes
    With a dark red headband of unusual size
    He grinned, his big buckteeth stretched out to the sides

    I'm think thats its time I change up the tides
    Your a pest your a dog your a bee your a louse
    I need to do Cory inside of the house

    Oh god no, I knew this would be how it ends
    At the end of my presidency, betrayed by my friends
    Jhon please, you know me, I'm no stranger to you

    But did Jhon even care?
    (Waht that buton do?)
