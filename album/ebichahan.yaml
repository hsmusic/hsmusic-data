Lyrics: |-
    I cook my dinners for an audience
    At least that's what I'd like to do
    Lately it's me and my irrelevance
    Garnished with hopeless love for you

    I cut these onions 'til I cry
    Sear my heart on every side
    Golden brown and lightly fried
    I just don't know what I'm to do
    With this meal I made for two...
    Unless I cook for you!

    I made a home-cooked meal
    Full of everything I feel
    And I send my love
    Through the searing stainless steel
    I hope you feel the heat
    'Cause you're everything to me
    Have this shrimp fried rice
    No more talking, let's just eat!

    You cook your dinners with no elegance
    Nothing pretty, just some food
    That might be why you're such a pessimist
    Every day its plain white rice and chicken breast with protein powder, it's petulant!

    Sous vide it slowly for a day
    While the lonely hours away
    Watch those colors turn to grey
    Wouldn't your dinner feel complete
    With some savory and sweet?
    Just come and cook with me!

    I made a home-cooked meal
    Full of everything I feel
    And I send my love
    Through the searing stainless steel
    I hope you come and eat
    'Cause it's such a tasty treat
    Have this shrimp fried rice
    Grab a plate and take a seat!

    Oh, Shrimp Miku in the place to be
    You want a shrimp fajita or a shrimp scampi?
    I got thirty-nine methods to prepare seafood
    And I'd make up a million more for you
    You make my heart beat wild and free
    Now I'm seeing colors that I can't perceive
    Baby don't back down, take a chance on me
    And no, I don't give a shit about your shellfish allergy!

    I don't care!
    You're gonna eat this fried rice I made for you
    Or... or there's gonna be problems!
    You hear me?

    I made a home-cooked meal
    Full of everything I feel
    And I send my love
    Through the searing stainless steel
    I hope you feel the heat
    'Cause you're everything to me
    Have this shrimp fried rice
    No more talking, let's just eat!
