Lyrics: |-
    I have been dreaming of all i could've done differently
    I only ever seem to say what i mean while you sleep
    While you sleep

    I'm not a wreck, but i'm far from fully healed --
    I found these ghosts in me; these memories i can't keep
    I can't keep

    I'm learning confidence, i'm only learning now how to
    Bite back the bitterness, the weight of the crown
    Of fools

    I can't express
    The weight of the silence

    But when it's filled with your breath
    I seem to fеar it less

    Rhythmic footsteps
    I'm so damn restlеss

    But i'm starting to call you
    Home

    I know how hard it is; i'm living through ache of the
    Worries and uncertainties that kept you awake, my love

    You and i are different, but that shouldn't hurt again, i am
    More than in love, i'll be as sweet as i can for you
    For you

    I think there's a way to make you more than mostly happy;
    I'll do anything at all, anything at all

    Somewhere i'm so afraid of you;
    You keep losing sight of the breakthrough
    As if long drives and quoting lines
    From our music
    Is not worth working for

    All i want is one place
    To be loud, to be loved, to be safe
    And i am so hoping
    I am so hoping

    Open-hearted
    Waters uncharted
    We're back where we started
    And i'm starting
    To call you
    Home
