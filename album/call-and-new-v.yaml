    'Cause I woop butt and game hardcore
    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin
    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    When I'm on the scoreboard, you sure can tell!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
