Lyrics:
    And when you kissed me, it was the sound that the pebbles on the riverbank make when you shift one from its place, and the rest fall in to fill the gap.
    And all the hate you hold for me was lightning three-tongued, and the feeling of sliding dice between the palms of your cold and clammy hands.

    I can't claim to remember which radio stations I took audio from, but I used this websdr - <a href="http://k3fef.com:8901/">http://k3fef.com:8901/</a>

Lyrics:
    All green things growing under every sky,<br>All hands reaching into grave,<br>Every horse's chest drums out the sound, the<br>Beating beating of hearts, feet and fists,<br>On the ground, on the ground, on your body;<br>On your body, on your skin,<br>And every building falls and flowers grow;<br>And seabirds cry the sounds<br>Of Now and Here and Salt and Fear and Open;<br>And the eyes of the fox are open, and the eyes<br>Of the rabbit are open, and the grass<br>Will never stop, and the sun<br>Rolls down your mountain bones, leaving<br>Scorched grass,<br>And a lamb, eyes closed and stiff and cold,<br>In your arms so heavy;<br>Soft soft its skull and gold and dull,<br>We wait for rain.
    What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?<br>Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!<br>Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!<br>Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!<br>Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!<br>Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!<br>Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!<br>Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!<br>Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!<br>Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!<br>They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!<br>Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!<br>Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!<br>Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!<br>Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

Lyrics:
    I'll be quiet to keep you quiet.<br>Don't concern yourself with my slow dying.<br>Through the vents I hear you sigh.<br>I don't get too high these days.<br>Your floor is my ceiling.<br>Lights out, you can't come in.<br>If you don't remind me, I won't forget you.<br>If you don't ask, I won't upset you.<br>I am jet black.<br>I am stone cold.<br>Jet black to the center.<br>Funny like a funeral.<br>I need you to bury me.<br>White noise in black room dust.<br>These hands long for one last touch.<br>Hourglass all out of trust.<br>I don't scratch so I won't itch.<br>I don't reach so I won't miss.<br>I taste our last kiss.<br>This is the cure: the same as the symptom.<br>Simple and pure: break to keep fixing.<br>Patiently nurse, patient and nurse.<br>This is the part I wouldn't show you.<br>The part where you say, "I don't even know you."<br>This is your cue.<br>Be glad it's through.

Lyrics:
    As I came through the desert: Air once more,<br>And I was close upon a wild sea-shore;<br>Enormous cliffs arose on either hand,<br>The deep tide thundered up a league-broad strand;<br>White foambelts seethed there, wan spray swept and flew;<br>The sky broke, moon and stars and clouds and blue:<br>And I strode on austere;<br>No hope could have no fear.
    As I came through the desert thus it was,<br>As I came through the desert: On the left<br>The sun arose and crowned a broad crag-cleft;<br>There stopped and burned out black, except a rim,<br>A bleeding eyeless socket, red and dim;<br>Whereon the moon fell suddenly south-west,<br>And stood above the right-hand cliffs at rest:<br>Still I strode on austere;<br>No hope could have no fear.
     I dream of you rising up out of the ocean, skeletons of coelacanths caught in your horns, licking kelp from between your teeth, feeding drowned decadence with the gilded petals of the world above. Better it be yours than mine, an empty sinking pit of hunger tunnelling down to the centre of the earth, chewing red flesh and spitting black seeds.
     the rain pulls down curtains around you, flooding subway stations and cascading down the glass sheet faces of skyscrapers. I see the future in refracted light, and it is the rainbow in a puddle of oil. The scattered remnants of the way we used to live adorn our walls, sit abandoned in drawers, in brief moments of recollection, at the edge of conversations, foam flecks on a black table, lights adorning street-sides, between blank walls of concrete reaching up into the sky.

Lyrics:
    Does the road wind up-hill all the way?<br>Will the day’s journey take the whole long day?
    But is there for the night a resting-place?<br>May not the darkness hide it from my face?
    Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?<br>Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?
    Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?<br>Will there be beds for me and all who seek?
