Lyrics: |-
    (Here's the truth)
    (As a share of the economy we spend less on domestic priorities)
    (Outside of social security Medicare and Medicaid)
    (We spend less...)
    (than we did when Ronald Reagan was president)
    (Fact is, I feel more loose and relaxed than ever)
    (Those Joe Biden shoulder massages, they're like magic)
    (Bucket!) [laughter]
