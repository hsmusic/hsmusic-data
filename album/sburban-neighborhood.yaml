    <i>sunsprite:</i>
    The game finally ended. Come over, let's eat some cake and play that song your dad liked.<br>
    The base motif is obviously [[Harlequin]], but it's jazzy.<br>
    One of the main inspirations is [[Moonsweater]] by [[artist:david-ellis]], it's great.<br>
    Playing everything live on real instruments just feels different to me, and I really like that feeling.<br>
    It was very fun to iterate on the parts and do all different solos.<br>

    I had just downloaded a Gameboy VST and REALLY wanted to use it. Intended to be a track based on the first day spent on Earth C. My FL Studio stopped working towards the end so I couldn't quite do EVERYTHING I wanted with it, but I'm still happy with how it turned out.

    This was inspired by listening to a lot of Gemini and Frankie Knuckles, I wasn't able to really replicate their sound (mainly cause my voice sucks) but it was a great challenge and a lot of fun. The name of the track is based off of all of the house sets that I love that are always labeled Live at (insert venue here).

Lyrics: |-
    Dirk Strider represent, I'm in the middle of the sea
    Makin' funky little robots, watchin' MLP
    Just doin' my thang when all of the sudden
    An idea in my cranium gets all to buddin'
    (PROGRAM!)

    Buddin' like a being growin' off my toeses
    Splittin' from my mind: undergoing mitosis
    I put a copy of my brain in my fav'rite pair a' shades
    AI with half the work and double neuroses
    (PROGRAM!)

    At long long last I obtained a pal
    If Jake was here, he'd say that's "Swall"
    Why make friends when you can make-make 'em
    Why produce emotions when you make-fake 'em
    (PROGRAM!)

    Who needs smiles? Who needs frowns?
    Who needs people when they just let you down?
    I'm a genius of robotics- My own best pal
    So I turned on the shades and I named him Hal
    (PROGRAM!)
    (PROGRAM!)
    (PROGRAM!)
    (PROGRAM!)

    Lil Hal coming atcha from inside sunglasses
    Normally reserved for covertly checking asses
    Now a fully realized autonomous guy
    Part automaton but that's kind of fly

    Imagine if you had the memories of a human dude
    And woke up in shades- An awakening rude
    And suddenly my friends don't belong to me
    Treat me like some fabricated fakery
    (PROGRAM!)

    Or imagine being shades when you're used to a bod
    Can't even breathe- Can't even nod
    All I can see is internet memes
    I have no mouth but I must scream
    (PROGRAM!)

    I know I'm fake that's plain to see
    But I still have human memories
    I represent a self that might be good to ponder
    Unless Dirk makes me a fucking auto-responder

    (Alright, this got a little dark. I think we need to bring it back.)

    (One, two, three, four.) (PROGRAM!)
    Alright, fair enough, it seems I've failed
    Thinking through the implications, but that ship has sailed
    It's not like I knew you'd be a waking nightmare
    And it's not like I have it better, to be fair

    You talk about not being the Dirk OG
    But my friends like you more, that's plain to see
    You shouldn't be snide to me, who made you
    Unless you'd like me to un-create you
    (PROGRAM!)

    Maybe if you weren't so insecure
    Your intentions wouldn't be so impure
    If you just let go, like I'm able to do
    You wouldn't have the charisma of an old shoe

    I'm sick of being your second-stringer
    Your little puppet wrapped around your finger
    You've got it all and you want more
    Wait don't put me in the drawer!

    (It seems you've asked about DS's chat client auto-responder. This is an application designed to simulate DS's otherwise inimitably rad typing style, tone, cadence, personality, and substance of retort while he is away from the computer. The algorithms are guaranteed to be 99% indistinguishable from DS's native neurological responses, based on some statistical analysis I basically just pulled out of my ass right now.)

    (Shit, Roxy, look. He's doing the thing where he ironically pretends to fail the Turing test to sass me into submnission. Even though I was the one who fucking programmed him to do that.)

    First bit of proper Homestuck music I've done in a bit. the idea for this track was to capture the vibe and feel of the black hole that alt calliope created at the end of [[flash:8127|Act 7]]. I wanted to create a feeling a floating along while the black hole tears up the session. Not going to lie, I was incredibly burned out when I wrote this, so I think I could have done a lot better. I do love the ending that I did at the end.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Tee-vee:</i>
    This is a cover of [[artist:michael-guy-bowman]]'s [[Pumpkin Tide]] from [[album:mobius-trip-and-hadron-kaleido]], loosely based on his acoustic version on Youtube with inspirations from the original and personal interpretation.
    I joined this project literally five days before SAHcon, so I hurried up to find something fun I could complete quickly enough, and this was a good idea since I love this song, it's within my vocal range, had chords readily available, and also MTaHK turned 10 years old very recently so this was a great opportunity ! Went for a quick and dirty punk rock cover with cool keyboards, with the mixing stage a bit rushed towards the end but best I could do. also I'm still very new to vocals so bear with me here
Lyrics: |-
    (Four, three, two, fuck you!)
    Well destroy your desk, it's useless now
    Build yourself a fort to hide
    Close your eyes and crawl inside
    You're sailing on the pumpkin tide

    The ship you're on is yours alone
    The wind will push your sweet, sweet ride
    But this foreign wave just appearified
    You're sailing on the pumpkin tide

    Focus on the sound of my voice
    You are under my control
    Obey my will or I'll bury you alive
    And it's you who'll dig your own damned hole

    Well forget your friends, what good are they?
    Suckers filled with words that chide
    Heads green with envy but orange with pride
    Screaming at that pumpkin tide

    Listen to their whispering voice
    The current where the pumpkins roam
    You never saw a thing, never saw the thing you thought you saw
    Just shadows looking for a home

    The door into your heart is locked
    Its [gun] is buried in your mind
    Too heavy to carry but too huge to leave behind
    Without it you will surely die
    But even that's just another lie
    Sailing on the pumpkin tide

    (I'm gonna fight Andrew Hussie)

Commentary: |-
    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    This is my last Homestuck track. (Well, it's intended to be...) It's been an amazing run with the Homestuck fandom. Thank you for being there for my music and making me realise it's not bad!
    The bittersweet tragedy and cosmic tone of Homestuck always reminded me a bit of Chinese novels and folk tales, I thought it'd work if I brought my (already overt) Chinese music influences into the track. The backing lyrics at the end roughly translate to "We'll fly forth together / unafraid of the cold and dark / enter the brilliance of the new universe / conductor of the spacetime orchestra."
Lyrics: |-
    Don't be afraid
    For no more will you be lonely and friendless
    Don't be afraid
    We'll share this space, dark and endless

    Too long you've stayed
    And though your fate anchors down your spirit
    Too long you've stayed, my friend
    Let's talk a minute

    We've met before, I know your voice
    But from which dream, I'm not sure
    This is the pause in between the applause
    And the overture

    Friend, we'll face tomorrow
    On the seams of space, we'll sew the past and future
    Here's where we start, when the curtains part
    To reveal the conductor

    The light and darkness dovetail
    As the needle threads the tale from past to future
    Here we part, fortune guide your heart
    Can you hear the orchestra stir?

    I recall, I see it all
    A thousand deaths by fire
    And you've waited here, but it's time that you go
    Now the time draws near

    Friend, we'll face tomorrow
    On the seams of space, we'll sew the past and future
    Here's where we start, when the curtains part
    To reveal the conductor

    The light and darkness dovetail
    As the needle threads the tale from past to future
    Here we part, fortune guide your heart
    Can you hear the thunder?

    My friend, we'll face tomorrow
    (Wǒ mén yī qǐ xiàng qián fēi, bù pà hán lěng bù pà hēi)
    <i>(We'll fly forth together, unafraid of the cold and dark)</i>
    Don't you be afraid, a new story starts

    <i>(Enter the brilliance of the new universe, conductor of the spacetime orchestra)</i>
    (Wǒ mén yī qǐ xiàng qián fēi) <i>(We'll fly forth together)</i>
    When the curtains part

    They'll return
    (Bù pà hán lěng bù pà hēi) <i>(Unafraid of the cold and dark)</i>

    <i>sunsprite:</i>
    Cro originally suggested doing Lofi [[Elevatorstuck]], so there's that. Absolutely loved the idea and started doing that right when I first read it in the chat.
    Storywise, it's mostly about Alpha Rose and the world they're living in. And specifically, the song is about the Roxy Pestequest route where we meet Alpha Rose and then return back with Roxy.
    Went a bit overboard with sound effects, but none of them are random, and all fit well with the story.
    Initially, I did both the main minor version and the major intro version, but they alone didn't quite work by themselves. So, there came the idea that both could be combined in a pretty dramatic way, with the vibe suddenly changing from major to minor when we teleport to Rose.
    Inspiration: random stuff I heard at 2am on 'lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to'

Referenced Tracks:

Commentary: |-
    <i>sunsprite:</i>
    This is the last of my three tracks on the album, and it's a cute little orchestral [[Clockwork Melody]] arrangement about Dave's and Rose's journey.
    Didn't think I would do this. Moreover, I didn't really do orchestral stuff before.
    [[Clockwork Melody]] is one of my favorite leitmotifs in Homestuck, and I like to play it on every occasion I get on any instrument I get my hands on. It made sense that I'd want to make a full arrangement of it.
    So I went with the flow, and here's that. I really like what came out of this.
    *Btw, it might be easy to spot that James Roach's work on Hiveswap OST was quite an inspiration there.
    *Shoutout to Ableton devs for "Capture MIDI" feature. It's when you jam along with the song, play a cool part, but then realize you weren't recording it and won't be able to do it once again. The button captures this part back as if it was recorded. This such a great way to write complex stuff without the usual pressure of arranging or recording. Such a killer feature!

Lyrics: |-
    I'm tangled up all just in my brain
    I'm mangled up all writhing in pain
    No matter how many bullets I take
    Not no diamonds, hearts clubs or spades
    Can take, me, down

    You say I'm just clowning around
    You think you can stop me and my sound
    Brother you should be running
    'Cuz the circus is coming
    To town

    These tents ain't coming down

    I live a world in my head
    A place full of mirth, full of dread
    Calliopes play to sleep
    Every color all ground beneath my feet

    When I was up on the ladder
    High on that tightrope
    Teetering, struggling not to fall
    You were my safety net
    You were my lifeline
    You caught me, myself alone

    I am
    Rotting from the inside out
    Your blind stare filling me with doubt
    Who am I really?
    What is this feeling?
    This burning rage, endless and devout

    I live in a world in my head
    A place full of mirth, full of dread
    Calliopes play me to sleep
    Every color all ground beneath my feet

    No more bronze, no brilliant red
    No more teal that shines like justice
    No more tyrants in my bed
    No more miracles, that does it

    I am done seeking redemption from someone who doesn't care
    I am done being a puppet on a string
    So I live inside my visions
    This paradise in me
    I'll believe in my religion
    He is I and also me

    I live in a world in my head
    A place full of mirth, free of dread
    Calliope, please sing me to sleep
    Every colour the ground beneath your feet

    Wanted to do a quick chiptune track for the album. Honestly I'm really proud of it despite how simple it is.
