Lyrics: |-
    To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
    Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes (Uh)
    Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
    The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me (What?)
    The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me (Uh)
    Mad question askin', blunt passin'
    Music blastin', but I just can't quit
    Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with (That's right)
    Sleep with, keep the EP a secret, why not? (Uh)
    Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
    Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
    Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy (Come on)
    No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
    C-notes by the layers--

Lyrics: |-
    So they're finally here, performing for you,
    If you know the words, you can join in too,
    Put your hands together, if you want to clap,
    As we take you through, this monkey rap!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!

    He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well,
    He's finally back to kick some tail,
    His Coconut Gun can fire in spurts,
    If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt,
    He's bigger, faster, and stronger too,
    He's the first member of the D.K. crew!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    D.K., Donkey Kong is here!

    This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes,
    She can shrink in size, to suit her mood,
    She's quick and nimble when she needs to be,
    She can float through the air and climb up trees!
    If you choose her, you'll not choose wrong,
    With a skip and a hop, she's one cool Kong!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!

    He has no style, he has no grace,
    Th-th-th-this Kong has a funny face,
    He can handstand when he needs to,
    And stretch his arms out, just for you,
    Inflate himself just like a balloon,
    This crazy Kong just digs this tune!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    D.K., Donkey Kong is here!

    He's back again and about time too,
    And this time he's in the mood,
    He can fly real high with his jetpack on,
    With his pistols out, he's one tough Kong!
    He'll make you smile when he plays his tune,
    But Kremlings beware 'cause he's after you!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    Huh!

    Finally, he's here for you,
    It's the last member of the D.K. crew!
    This Kong's so strong, it isn't funny,
    Can make a Kremling cry out for mummy,
    Can pick up a boulder with relative ease,
    Makes crushing rocks seem such a breeze,
    He may move slow, he can't jump high,
    But this Kong's one hell of a guy!

    Huh!
    C'mon Cranky, take it to the fridge!

Lyrics: |-
    I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
    Watch you smile while you are sleeping
    While you're far away and dreaming
    I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
    I could stay lost in this moment forever
    Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

    Don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
    And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
    Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
    Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
    And I just wanna stay with you
    In this moment forever
    Forever and ever

    I don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    I don't wanna miss one smile
    I don't wanna miss one kiss
    Well, I just wanna be with you
    Right here with you, just like this
    I just wanna hold you close
    I feel your heart so close to mine
    And just stay here in this moment
    For all the rest of time
    Yeah, (Yeah) Yeah, (Yeah) Yeah!

    Don't wanna close my eyes
    Don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    I don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    Don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah

Lyrics: |-
    (Bowman: I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks.
    Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty.
    The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money.
    I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty.
    Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score.
    This number is between my buttocks.
    This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty.
    The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money.
    But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is?
    It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks.
    The number is seven hundred and twenty.
    But do you know what number I'm thinking of?
    I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks.)

    (SiIvaGunner: Thank you for showing me this. It is as bad as I had imagined)
    (SiIvaGunner: This needs to stop.)
    (Bowman: I'm--) [shots]
    (SiIvaGunner: Let this be your last warning, Cool and New Music Team)
    (SiIvaGunner: Let's go, my friend, and hope they have learned their lesson about overdone memes)
    (SiIvaGunner: Wait, what is this? A high quality video game rip? I will take this too)

    You against the HUSH

    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH

    Further down the road
    Nameless as a babe
    Lost within the cold
    Aimless as a grave
    Ears could not relate
    Eyes would not adjust
    Creatures of the day
    All fell into HUSH

    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
