    D-D-D-D-DO IT!
Commentary: |-
    <i>Discfortune:</i> (Composer)
    Okay so when I make songs I usually start out with a dumb gimmick and then I haphazardly flesh it out to an acceptable point (ex. with 72.0x SHOWDOWN COMBO it was the name, with [[track:tick|Tick]] and [[track:tock|Tock]] it was the songs being able to be layered and panned, and with [[track:ringleader-canmt|Ringleader]] it was the time signature). Here I sort of started out with that--I was buying Dr. Pepper for a meme at the grocery store when an 11/8 tune came into my mind and I decided to run with it. It was pretty standard, and as usual I made progress rather slowly. The idea was to slowly build up time signatures to reflect the song building up in intensity and soundscape thickness (you might be able to pick out the song going from 11/8, to 12/8, to 13/4, to 14/8, to 4/4). Then later that week [[artist:cecily-renns|JohnJRenns]] gave a whole spiel on how people take too long to make songs for the sake of making them "the best ever" and that in order to improve we should be maximizing speed over quality to gain experience in retrospect. At first I said "okay that's a good idea maybe I'll do that" but then I thought to myself "no, f*** that, I'm going to do whatever the hell I want with this dumb song, it doesn't even need a gimmick". So I did that, and it took a long time, and it was a little bit tiring, but it was fun. I'll probably do this more often: just having fun.
    The song uses a lot of synths, which is relatively new to me. But it was interesting to get a little bit more room to work with, EQ-wise. Also, my motif spacing was really weird. There's this one section before the piano Aggrieve where I vomited out like 3 or 4 motifs because I realized I wasn't being canwc-relevant enough. Probably the hardest part of making the song was the length. In general, it's really hard for me to make anything longer than 2 minutes because I hate looping/repeating sections.
    At the end of the day I guess the song was supposed to serve as the next in a long line of "songs that Crypt made to experiment with new genres"" but I think Spacetime Starstriker sounds too much like a more realized form of [[track:light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel|Light at the End of the Tunnel]] from [[album:call-and-new-2-locomotif|Train Game]]. But hey, it got me to listen to more electronic music, which I almost never do outside of Homestuck. If I never release my solo album, imagine this as track three. Well, have fun with the rest of the album. It's probably our best one. Don't let [[artist:makin|Makin]] tell you otherwise. MEME

    During June, I thought it would be funny if I gave the RCT melody to Harlequin, so I did. Then I later became a part of the canmt and thought, "hey, wouldn't this be a funny and relevant joke/song to have?" Then I checked around and found that there was a [[track:harlecoaster|Vol. 1 song]] with the same general idea, but in a different, er, style. And that's how this song got made.

    <i>SplitSuns:</i> (Composer)
    Back in April, [[artist:gorillaz|Gorillaz]] were getting ready to release their new album Humanz. With some coaxing from CaNMT members, I decided to create a mashup for the YouTube channel that would combine the Gorillaz track "Saturnz Barz" with the various trailer music we've heard so far in Hiveswap. Part of the song was set to go with a Hiveswap trailer as a [[artist:siivagunner|SiivaGunner]]-esque bait and switch, and the whole song would be uploaded as a Gorillaz rip. While initially successful, the latter rip was actually striked off of the channel, and the former video was privated to avoid another strike. I later released in on my SoundCloud and am now releasing it on 9 so that you all can hear it once more! As for the song itself, I stuck true to Saturnz Barz' original structure and made sure the Hiveswap music went well with the stops and skips in the song. I also snuck some other Homestuck music in there to make the rip more dynamic. Enjoy!

    <i>SplitSuns:</i> (Artist)
    When Secretz Barz was originally uploaded onto the YouTube channel, it didn't have any special track art. For its release on my SoundCloud, I decided to give it some! I decided to go with a straight parody of the Humanz cover, replacing the members of Gorillaz with various characters from Hiveswap. I stuck with 3D models only to mirror the detailed 3D avatars of the Gorillaz' members on the Humanz cover, and I also tried to arrange the characters in ways that were reminiscent of the poses on the original cover. The end result is something I'm quite proud of. Also, just so we're clear, I made this more than a month before the existing cover to 9 was made, so any refrance is entirely coincidental.

    Okay so, I had an idea, where I wanted to make some bullshit song, and I found a chord progression I liked... so I took it, and thought... "Let's bullshit this.", and so I did. It was originally a fully original track but then I had the masterstroke of coming across a theory involving Lil Cal and the big man, and i got attached. I then changed the main melody into a rendition of the intro vocals to Space Jam, and the rest is history.... (I also had to shorten the intro three entire times.)

    fucc boi, So I asked Sean Evans if I could use some samples from his tracks, so that happend.

    <i>Ephemerald:</i> (Artist)
    The track art is basically a blatant reference to Backbone's track art, in which Papyrus (brother of Sans Undertale) is wearing Sans' jacket and has a crazed expression, presumably because something something bad times. I decided to allude to this by drawing Jack Noir wearing the outfit of Spades Slick (or, Sleck, I guess), with basically the same pose and expression. Since the original image was meant to convey an Undertale battle screen (which is in deliberate black-and-white) I started with a white outline on a black background, only adding sparing splashes of color, then going with grey shading. Overall I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. (And what are you talking about, the minimalistic approach definitely isn't because I was pressed for time. It was purely a stylistic choice.) To those who are wondering why Jack has a sword instead of a knife, it looks cooler.

    <i>SplitSuns:</i> (Composer)
    This song was originally supposed to be for [[album:jpeg|the .jpeg album]], but I wasn't able to finish the song in time. When .jpeg was still in production and yaz showed me the track art he was designing, he expressed interest in having me return to the BLANK JIMMEE persona to create another vaportrap song. I was more than happy to return to the character, especially since I had recently acquired the synth Massive. This let me use some of the instruments Blank Banshee himself used in his songs! For Echo Chamber in general, I wanted to make the song more in the vein of Blank Banshee's most recent album, MEGA. This meant more intricate production and layered samples than before. I used a lot of sounds from various video games, and also tried to chop and screw vocals more than I had with the previous song (especially with my main man Donald Trump, may his reign last a thousand years.) This song was very complicated, but I think it all came together in the end. To those of you familiar with Blank Banshee's work, I hope I was able to pull off his sound convincingly. To those of you who aren't, I hope the song sounds good regardless!

The theme was of Rose "escaping from the shittiness" so I had her positioned as if she were falling  (or maybe leaping) from the terrifying shitty world. I got a lot of help from meems regarding colour and content and was able to make a dramatic piece that really reflected the song. Hooray for teamwork. Meems and I are a real ride or die duo.

    <i>Noisemaker:</i> (Composer)
    What originally started as an attempt to make 'motif stew' by throwing a bunch of Homestuck and CaNWC tracks into a melting pot actually turned out being one of my personal favorite tracks I've created for this project. I tried to make it as misleading as possible, with the shitty intro and the god-awful title (credit to cookiefonster, btw) setting your expectations lower than a game of limbo at the Smallville center for midgets. While it was stuck in development hell for a little while, I'm really pleased with how this turned out, and I hope I can continue making tracks like this until the end of time. Actually, probably not that long. That would suck after a little while.

    <i>Makin:</i> (Artist)
    I actually redrew the rose at the bottom right but then it turned out to be unnecessary. Whoops. Guns are hard to draw from weird angles. Also, stop reading this and marvel at Noisemaker's amazing musical skills.

    Wow! Another medley! This song was written for a hypothetical battle between Lord English and Rose, Jack, and Hecka Jef. It took me... about a month to fully put together. Overall, I'm fairly happy where this ended up, and I hope you'll enjoy it.

    <i>Sozzay:</i> (Artist)
    This piece took me over a month to make and actually changed me as a person. It took me on a wild ride of self-doubt, procrastination, inspiration and perseverance. That sounds really dramatic but drawing this deadass had me experience a series of emotions and events that were perhaps the most life changing moments in the years I have lived. Basically, this piece actually fucked my shit up. But I am really glad with how it turned out and honestly would do it all again. I hope I gave Mines' song justice because it's so fun and was what I listened to when adding the finishing touches to this piece. This whole experience rocked my world and I will forever love this song because of it. This is very emotional perhaps it's because I'm writing this at 2am. I've written "this piece" too much.

Lyrics: |-
    (I'm sitting here like, dude, let's do some comics, let's do some music, let's do some fucking voice act— that's fun.)

    [Sampled vocals from "feeling right" by Moe Shop]

    (I want your everything, every single part of you)
    (If you think you can fuck with me, you're going to lose)
    (I want to taste your love, anything you want to do)
    (And I'll kill you if you try to run, you're mine and mine alone)

    [Heavily glitched]
    (They don't love you like I do, they don't love you like I do)
    (They don't love you like I do, they don't love you like I do)

    (Then it's like hey, uhh, what about we just be super cancerous and uhh, make like a buncha shit. Um, but you have so much other stuff you can do. You have good, like, music people who are willing to do music. But, like what if we made memes! I mean, yeah that's fun, but how about some real stuff? Nah, I like memes. Alright.)

    The goal in mind was canmt-tan drawn in a more anime style with a colour scheme of light blue, pink and/or purple. I went about this piece as normal and admittedly wasn't too confident with how things were turning out at first, but I kept going and ended up really satisfied with the final product. Lately I haven't been creating pieces this bright and light-hearted, so, despite the difficulties, it was a very nice and new experience. Jaspy is great and cool.

    This was originally a song I made to practice piano because I was having trouble finding songs I wanted to play at a difficulty that I could attempt. A few people told me to add instruments to it, so it turned into the orchestral composition that it is today. I'm extremely happy with the mixing, and I really like how the song changes keys. The melody is sort of boring though due to the purpose for which it was originally made.

    <i>Frost Carter:</i> (Composer)
    Hey, my first song for Canmt! I made the percussion and bass for this song ages ago, and I had pretty much scrapped them, but I was messing around with a song combining MeGaLoVania and Liquid Negrocity a wee bit back and I thought, "Hey, that thing that I scrapped would be perfect for this!" Even so, I didn't actually do much with it until I decided to do something for 9. At that point, I composed this in about 3 hours, did a bit of mixing, and that's how it ended up the way it is now.

    I tried to make a track art that looks corrupted without being shitty or unpleasant to look at.
    Okay but seriously, I thought it would be fun to make trackart that mixes corruption with non-corruption, and I found that the easiest way to do that was to export a low resolution JPEG and overlay that over the original image, and then erase the center. I did this with three different layers of JPEG compression.

Lyrics: |-
    Look
    If you had one shot or one opportunity
    To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
    Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

    His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
    There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
    To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
    What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
    He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
    He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
    The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
    Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
    There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
    Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
    His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
    He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
    When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
    Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
    Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better

    His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
    This world is mine for the taking, make me king
    As we move toward a New World Order
    A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
    Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
    Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
    These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
    He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
    God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
    He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
    But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
    These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
    They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
    He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
    Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
    But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better

    No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
    Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
    I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
    I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
    But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
    Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
    All the pain inside amplified by the
    Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
    Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
    'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
    And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
    And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
    Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
    Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
    Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
    Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
    Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
    To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
    Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
    Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
    To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
    So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
    This may be the only opportunity that I got

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better...

    You can do anything you set your mind to, man
    Mom's Spaghetti-ghetti
    Ghe-ghe-ghetti
    Ghe-ghe-ghetti
    (Ghe-ghe-ghe-ghe-ghe-ghe-ghetti...)

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Composer)
    Don't let the name fool you, this song mostly exists because I wanted to do something with Dialup from [[album:v8lume|Vol 8]] which is a song I like way too much. I decided to do what I always do: make a chiptune thing combining it with other random songs, and slap the Moshi label on it for good measure. I think it turned out pretty well even though I'll probably never surpass [[track:the-gemoni-mustard-blood|that one song]] from [[album:of-troles-and-chiptumes|my solo album]] that's on [[album:cool-and-new-greatest-hits|Greatest Hits]]. I'm not joking, [[artist:makin|Makin]] literally told me to make this more like that song.

    <i>Ephemerald:</i> (Artist)
    Bob drew the NES, the Nintendo-esque "Cool and New Music Team" logo at the bottom, and the CANMT-Tan Seal of Approval. He also sketched up a general outline for how the image would go, which I followed the best I could (while also putting my own take on it). His sketch for Moshi Moshi's boxart looked like Dr. Eggman lying down on a level of Super Mario Bros., so... that's what I drew. The quotes on the upper-left are also taken verbatim from the image outline, because I think they're perfect the way they are. The background with the fuchsia lines is actually an image from one of the endgame levels of FEZ. I included it because I thought it looked 80s, I guess. This entire image was meant to feel dated, like it was actually from thirty years ago, so I tried to reference some NES-era boxarts (like Mega Man 2) with how I wrote the text. Lastly, I added a sepia filter over the whole thing to sell the whole "thirty years ago" aesthetic. Bob, if you're reading this, I hope I did good.

    <i>bobthetacocat:</i> (Artist)
    hi this is bob and yes you did good holy fucking shit you nailed it
    bob commentary: i made the nes and the canmt tan and the canmt nintendo logo just like build said, and i posted the sketch, and then i had to leave for camp until the first of july, which is when i'm tying this, actually
    but yeah twin did a great job with what i left and i give my utmost thanks

    <i>Ephemerald:</i> (Artist)
    I ended up replacing Eggman with Fat Vrasky, which was what was intended from the original outline. One final note of commentary is that I drew both Eggman and Vrasky deliberately using only colors that the NES could display, to make it as authentic as possible. Alright, now I'm done, I swear!

    <i>TirantBacon:</i> (Composer)
    I made this song as an attempt to somehow convey the character of Jaed into song form. Each section of the song represents a significant self-observed character trait of Jaed: Wacky, unfortunate and possibly psychotic. It's composition is reminiscent of [[group:toby-fox|Radiation's]] composition style (of course), but I tried to at least keep it my own style in the later half of the song. Although I might make an extended version in the future, perhaps with certain animal noises... Keep a look out for that! :D

Commentary: |-
    <i>Pipko Fanfare:</i> (Composer)
    This song started off with me noticing how the chord progressions for flare and old secret are based on the same descending tetrachord bass motif (similar to the one used in megalovania) but with different executions and upper voices. So I tried to blend them together just for some arrangement practice since that was a thing I was doing at the time and it ended up turning into this whole big thing. The idea for it to represent the crazy journey that Hussie has been taking us through over the years - starting off deceptively simple and just growing into this complex intertwined mess of weird time shit and paradoxes and black holes and self-referencial madness - came surprisingly late into the process but helped me make the final call on some arrangement details that I think help it "tell a better story" if that makes sense. (And yes, I know Under The Hat and Pumpkin Cravings aren't REALLY PS tracks but come on you and I both know they FEEL like Problem Sleuth.)

Lyrics: |-
    (A-a-a-are you ready?)
    Old Lord Spanish was stompin around
    His own Felt Manor like a big playground
    When suddenly Vaska burst from the shade
    And hit Lord Spanish with a ball of eight
    Lord Spanish was pissed and decided to strife
    Right before getting stabbed by a really dull knife
    When the fearsome Jack Noir burst onto the scene
    As Jaed Hardly crashed it in a flash of green
    And she sicced her doggod on the Sovereign Slayer
    But they heard someone shout "Yo homes smell ya later!"
    Out came Kraket with some weapons and loot
    And Dabe Stidrer too in his birthday suit
    And he took a pair of handcuffs from his cold, chained hands
    Locked Vaska to a clonk all according to plan
    As sirens blared on in a violent clamour
    Femorafreak vowed to send the trole to the slammer

    This is the ultimate "[[artist:o|o]]"down of ultimate destiny
    Cool guys, new guys, and webcomics
    As far as the eye can see
    And only one will survive
    I wonder who it will be?
    This is the ultimate "o"down of ultimate destiny

    Lord Spanish threw a punch at Femorafreak
    And called on Cans to knock him into next week
    Then Jack came back ready for his next attack
    But Hecka Jef ran in and stabbed him in the back
    And Vrasky had realized the cop had lost her trail
    When Dabe Stidrer knew he'd be sending her to jail
    But he suddenly stopped and his blood ran cold
    And daddy Jhon Ebgret put him in a chokehold
    And he saw Lord Spanish sneaking up from behind
    So he reached for his ham which he just couldn't find
    Cause Vrasky stole it from him for some extra weight
    But Hecka Jef nabbed it off her fictional plate
    And he ran towards Jhon ready for revenge
    As Dabe sprang forward with a dad to defend
    As quick as a flash, they collided in the air
    And they both got spooked by a Lil Cal stare

    This is the ultimate "o"down of ultimate destiny
    Cool guys, new guys, and webcomics
    As far as the eye can see
    And only one will survive
    I wonder who it will be?
    This is the ultimate "o"down...

    Cherubs cried out
    A frightening jingle
    From the ninth circle
    Arose Chuck Tingle
    Who delivered a pounding
    Into Jhon's butt
    That ruptured his organs
    And made him nut
    And he fell on the ground
    His life now a mess
    As Vrasky absconded
    With Snoman's dress
    But Chuck saw right through
    Her clever disguise
    And tore her ass open
    With just his eyes

    Then Snoman's black inches and the staff of Hunk Rump
    And [[album:gunshow-singalong|Penumbra Gunshow Singalong's Trump]]

    [[album:mobius-trip-and-hadron-kaleido|Hadron Kaleido and Mobius Trip]]
    Itchy Momi and Bilious Slick

    All came out of nowhere lightning fast
    And pounded Chuck Tingle in his viral ass
    It was the sexiest battle that "o" would dare write
    With his readers looking on in hypnotized fright
    The battle ended to thunderous cheers
    When Hiveswap released after ten thousand years
    The champion stood, we bowed our heads and knew
    It was [[artist:neil-cicierega|Neil Cicierega]] giving credit where it's due

    This is the ultimate "o"down of ultimate destiny
    Cool guys, new guys, and webcomics
    As far as the eye can see
    And only one will survive
    I wonder who it will be?
    This is the ultimate "o"down (This is the ultimate "o"down)
    This is the ultimate "o"down (This is the ultimate "o"down)
    This is the ultimate "o"down... of ultimate destiny!

    <i>SplitSuns:</i> (Composer)
    While talking in the CaNMT server, I had the dumbest idea for a parody of the Neil Cicierega song "The Ultimate Showdown" wherein the various characters in the song were replaced with Homestuck and CaNWC characters. I wrote out the first verse on a whim, and I knew I had to make a full song around it. I wrote the lyrics first, and once wheals and I made sure they were of a sufficient quality, I started work on the instrumental. I tried to make it be as faithful to the original song as possible, but added my own twists to it through additional sequences and some light referencing of other Homestuck songs. Initially the instrumentation was very similar to Neil's work, but I later went back and changed it to make it more synth-y. I also experimented with fitting leitmotifs into the mix in a CaNH-style way where they fit with the lyrics, but I felt they were too shoehorned in. Finally, I approached WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES to help me out by actually singing the thing, since I can't sing for shit (not even in an ironically good way.) Once he was finished, I did my best to mix it into the song in a pleasing way. Making this song was a real challenge for me, since I never really work with vocals in my music. As a result, I don't feel it's my best work, but I hope you guys will enjoy it and find it funny!

    <i>Ephemerald:</i> (Artist)
    The original idea for this art was a mish-mash of a bunch of scenes from the "Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny" Flash animation made around a decade ago (you know the one) into one image, replacing the characters from the flash with the relevant characters from this song. I got as far as drawing Jhon staring at Lord Spanish/English before realizing that it would be way too cluttered and unnecessary, so instead Split and I searched through the entire animation to try and find a scene that we could use. I decided on copying a still where Mr. Rogers is shedding a single tear for all that fell in the majestic battle. Dabe isn't the victor of the "O"down (spoilers!), but since he's shown crying all the time in CANWC, I decided to draw him. (I also didn't feel like spoiling the ACTUAL victor.) And that's pretty much all there is to it.

    <i>WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES:</i> (Singer)
    Split asked me sing and I said yes so now I am a lord bow down to me

    This originally started as a sequel to [[track:of-orchids-and-roses|Of Orchids and Roses]]. I wanted to remix Mutiny, it was incredibly necessary. It is also probably the only reason this song exists. I also wanted to experiment with slightly more discordant and offputting compositions.

    I started off trying to make a parody of [[track:oppa-toby-style|OTS]] but using [[artist:cookiefonster|cookie's]] Rex Mille Geromius motif which is quite beautiful in itself. I then lost track and started making chaotic bullshit. I think it turned out well. (I haven't made a decent song since I made this, and it was 5 weeks ago, please help)

    <i>Makin:</i> (Artist)
    This was originally for [[track:the-souns-of-justis|The Souns of Justis]], but someone forgot to mention they had already done art for it, so I moved the art to something with femora's elitemotif. I painstakingly composed "justice must be a serve" using the Wub Machine DAW (Digital Audio Wubstation). Too advanced for most people. Don't even look it up.

I was going for a eurobeat feel, and keep it pretty pumped and good. It'd be cool to see it used in a quick boss fight flash or something

    This track was an attempt at creating some kind of "musical recap/description" of a scene (in this case Rose learning how to do the spacey thign). Here we can hear the background low-octave string ambient setting the atmosphere of loneliness, Rose being represented by violins and Aggrieve, Jack being represented by saxophone (sorry i totally forgot that dvs saxophone exists forgive me for my sins :c), the clonck he's trapped in by chiptune, and Rose learning the spacey thign by Frost.
    Also while writing this track I've first tried harmonizing, and I think it turned out... ok. At least I've been told so.

    I was learning about how arabic and other traditional eastern music varies from the modern western music that I'm so used to hearing. I decided to try and take what I was learning and apply it to a wanderers themed song. I never actually used any of what I learned other than how it's supposed to sound and what types of instruments are used. I wanted to use a legitimate Maqam (a word use for a type of eastern music scale) but they were so complex and had too many rules for me to keep track of, so I didn't bother.

    <i>Cloudaria:</i> (Artist)
    i was like "hey, [[album:the-wanderers|wanderers]] chiptune-y thing!!! cool!!!!" and made this. i also realized that i completely fucking forgot basically all the exiles in canwc, so i basically just threw wv, pm, and the big man because i remembered them existing at some point in time as exiles. enjoy.

    Song started out as an old 80s heavy bass dance track but then i realised it sounded much better with the light synth arps of Serum and Poizone. Then my friend, rumu11, created the art but that was rejected :jaedangry:. Overall, I think this is the most creative (get it?) song ive made so far. I might even rework this idea for a later song because it was so fun to work on. Anyway, hope you have a good day everyone <3

    I initially sang this song, improvising from the top of my head with random melodies being reached from my brain. While I was improvising I was recording it all in edison, and through whatever I came up with I transcribed all the good parts into a structured sequence. It's not the most "efficient" method of making music, but it certainly leads to interesting results :P
    Oh, the song? It's suppose to be the song that plays if Jhon ever fought Vrasky (although this song IS completely lacking of any musical motifs to tell you that...). I think if it ever was to be a used song, it would be a battle theme in some interactive fight sequence or something. I'm not fully going to say it WILL be used, because I can't read minds, but I enjoyed making it nonetheless, and I think that's all that matters :)

    <i>ft-rj:</i> (Artist)
    well i was sitting in my art program just sorta staring at a screen when i drew a vrasky
    and then i was like hey lets do art
    so i did it
    i then got the wonderful idea to turn it into a strife scene so i made jhon commit a very bad crime of dadde reversel and i think it really shocked vrasky so hard, especially with the barrage of hams and whatnot

    <i>Wights End:</i> (Artist)
    When I first heard this song, it reminded me a lot of Metroid, so I decided to base the art on the final portion of Super Metroid where Samus has to escape from Zebes in a limited amount of time. I also wanted to draw some actual track art though so I ended up doing a pixel art image with the super metroid UI at the top. I really like the way Jef came out, but the image as a whole doesn't look that great due to poor balancing of the elements in the frame. Unfortunately I don't think I can fix that without completely redoing the image.

    <i>Wheals:</i> (Composer)
    Ever since I heard the very well-made medley -3x piano solo in [[album:canwc-sound-test-1|sound test 1]], I wanted to make an arrangement that both had actual instrumentation and wasn't buried among the piles of rubbish on that album. [[artist:shwan|Shwan]] was kind enough to give me a MIDI, which I sat on for 8 months before cranking this out. The theme (and meaning of the name) of -3x piano solo (and this song too) may not be immediately obvious -- it's songs that were used in the comic from Acts 1-4. I had fun adding four more songs to Shwan's reference list, none of which are in [[album:homestuck-vol-1-4|*Volumes* 1-4]].

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Artist)
    Wheals' idea for this art was to make CANWC versions of scenes in every flash each song plays in, so I painstakingly redrew (read: pasted together images and poorly retraced) 24 different scenes from Homestuck, except for a few flashes that had an exact CANWC equivalent where I just stole a screenshot from the flash. Even though I barely actually drew anything (I can't draw to save my life), I'm legitimately proud of this art. Making a Fresh Jimmy version of the FreshJamz logo has to be my best accomplishment yet.

    <i>Ragzilla:</i> (Composer)
    I wanted to get like a Hotline Miami 80s theme for this one, with a mix of some modern sounds. I called it nobody knows because it sounds like a level in a game where you finally reveal like a big character or something, and thet last like 5 seconds you finally get to see the character.

    <i>Ephemerald:</i> (Artist)
    This is probably the track art I'm most proud of for 9. I saw that it was an original composition, which I got really excited about - I could do practically whatever I wanted with the art. So, I'm proud to present my headcanon appearance for "o". Based off of the fact that he goes by a Hella Jeff image, he's a disturbingly high-resolution Hella Jeff clad in a dapper blue cloak, with a nancho around his neck, and two charismatic items (the Tetrix of the Arbitor and the Ink of Squid Pro Quo) fastened to his belt. Just what could he be doing with such holy materials...? Nobody knows, my friends. Nobody knows but him. In all honesty, I had a blast coming up with "o"'s delightfully disturbing visage, and yes, that giant "o" DID take quite a while to shade.

    if you're reading the wiki [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUjbODCExlo) will make sense to you. Also, this track references the unreleased track "warriorheart.mp3" by StarlightCalliope. All we know is it was a [[track:fighting-spirit]] remix.

    Star wanted me to make it as awful as I possibly can but then I made it a bit better than that featuring Dabe as a staircase

    <i>StarlightCalliope:</i> (Composer)
    Dear god, where do I even start talking about this song? As I’m pretty darn sure you can tell based on both the title, theme, and general feel of the song, this song is intended to be a, “Descend-like,” medley for Cool and New Webcomic. It’s taken a long time to finish working on, (300 hours and work on it since January!!), but I am honestly really proud of how this song turned out. In the song, I referenced... about 44 different songs? Primarily songs released by this very Cool and New Music Team, with a decent bit of songs coming from the Homestuck Music Team, and one reference to a song from the, “[[album:weird-puzzle-tunes|Weird Puzzle Tunes]],” album.

    I think one of my favourite things about this, at least in terms of composing, was setting up specific musical ideas/motifs (and that’s the regular use of the term motif, not leitmotif/reference you fricks) and capitalizing on those ideas/motifs throughout the song. One of the most key ideas to the song as a whole, that’s rather integral to it feeling as fast as it does in certain sections, is the use of 32nd notes during portions using Synths. This is first set up during the Moshi Moshi section, and I used this repeatedly in the song both as a way to build tension and keep the listener engaged, and to add an extra bit of cohesivness to the piece as a whole. Repeating references/ideas is another method I used. Such as ending the song the same way it started, with this weird synthy thing from Final Fantasy 6 that has a bunch of delay on it playing a chord. I started the song using an E Minor chord using that thing, and ended the song on a big resolution using an E Major chord. Another example of this was through starting the song off using the same clocks that were used in [[track:cascante|Cascante]], and ending the song with those same clocks. (Albiet, it’s the end of the main part of the song, before the [[Penumbra Phantasm|Penumbra]]-esque bit on the piano with the Horrorterror noises.)

    Honestly, this track is by and far the song that I’ve put the most effort into out of everything that I’ve tried to make thus far, and I really am proud of it. Although, I do feel like the mixing is a tad lacklustre and there’s literally no mastering. I suppose this shows that I probably should try to improve in terms of Production, though according to a decent portion of the team I am fairly good at Composition, as based on this piece. Really, I am happy with it, and I’m glad to have finally made a song for a main album, as this is my first time doing so. I really hope you folks enjoy the song as much as I enjoyed composing it! :)

    I actually made quite a few songs between [[album:v8lume|volumes 8]] and 9, but the ones that werent used in [[album:intermishin|Intermishin]] or [[album:jpeg|JPEG]] had the weird problem of getting onto [[album:lofam4|LOFAM]], and werent that CANWC related anyway, so I decided to just revoke them from this project. In their place, I wanted something that was firmly rooted in CANWC, and what bette than a song about everyone’s favorite Act 4 walkaround character, Nakkin’ Ned? Many of the parts of this song were taken from the Bassnectar remix of Beats Antique’s “Roustabout” (go listen to it), and many of the other elements were fittingly inspired by Genesis Frog’s “Buy NAK Sell DOOF”. Thanks to everyone who supplied me with naks (I had so many i didnt even have to record myself), and especially those who went above and beyond, namely [[artist:ft-rj|underscore’s]] UN Owen Was Her? naks and [[artist:cecily-renns|JohnJRenns’]] nak soundfont.
