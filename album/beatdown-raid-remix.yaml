   <i>Raid:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://rudecustard.bandcamp.com/track/beatdown-raid-remix))
   This is a remix of [[track:beatdown-strider-style|"Beatdown,"]] composed by Curt Blakeslee for Homestuck. I loooove Beatdown. It fills me a fierce, fiery energy every time I hear it. I intended to channel that intensity with this remix here. I rushed it out just in time for 4/13 so it's a little rough around the edges, but like all of my music, it is my child, and so I still love it dearly. Hope you enjoy.

   <i>Raid:</i> ([extended description](https://pastebin.com/GaFE0ekU))
   On this date 12 years ago, a stupid webcomic that's far too long and weird and hilarious and all sorts of fucked up went online. Of course, I'm talking about Homestuck. It crashed [[flash:4109|Newgrounds]], broke metafictional barriers, ruined a lot of lives (not mine, miss me with that shit), and caused a big ruckus in its heyday. But I was along for the ride as a young tween/teen, and I quite enjoyed it.

   Some of the tunes from the webcomic's discography remain among my favorite tracks of all time because they evoke emotionally-rich memories of the past. [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]] by Curt Blakeslee is one of those tunes. I still remember being 12 years old, coming home from school and throwing all my homework aside to read Homestuck for hours, skipping every single pesterlog like a dumb little kid, just trying as hard as I could to blast through the thousands of pages that were out already and catch up to the comic's present. I think I caught up around the time when Andrew Hussie put the comic on pause for a long time. I don't remember exactly, though.

   The sound design (can I even call it that?) in this track took for fucking ever. I stole a couple of cool sound effects from familiar sources. That snap and filter sweep you keep hearing? That's Roy Mustang's flame alchemy. That blip-blip-blip? That's Falco's shine, of course. That high-pitched ding that I played layered with the snare in the middle? That's a sound effect from Danganronpa. I think it's the sound effect that plays when something surprising happens and some dialogue appears. The sword slashes and cuts are also from DR. The first game. Aside from that, we've got a whole bunch of presets, a whole lot of sounds I designed myself by screwing around in Ableton with plugins and effects, a bunch of free samples I downloaded off sketchy sites, a shit ton of meticulously drawn automation curves, and my very own Yamaha upright piano. I played all the piano in this track with my own two hands. That was hard. My right wrist still hurts from furiously playing that super verby high-register ostinato that comes in after 2:57. I think I nailed it, but you can be the judge of that.

   Anything else I got to say? No, not really. Well, I hate school, as always. School is a bitch. Music is keeping me sane, I guess. I'm really glad I got this track out for 4/13. I almost missed it.
