    <i>Makin:</i> (team manager)
    Every track remixes or references the one before it, with most musicians ignorant of the original track, like a broken telephone. The final track by [[artist:cecily-renns]] remixes every original melody in the album.

Lyrics: |-
    (Yuu)
    X gon' give it to ya (What?)
    Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya (Uh)
    Knock-knock, open up the door, it's real
    With the non-stop pop-pop from stainless steel
    Go hard, gettin' busy with it (Ooh)
    But I got such a good heart that I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it (Yeah)
    Damn right, and I'll do it again (Yeah)
    'Cause I am light so I gots to win (Uh, uh, uh)

    Phil's from the soul, Jack's from the P.I
    Horatio the Horat so big-eyed
    Tito Dick, "Dickman" baby
    He reaised Phil and loves the ladies

    Jack is cool and he's lazy, he's still learnin'
    Otherwise Cherry Pie, he's still a virgin (Ooh.)
    Chita, meet the freak of the week-ah (Week-ah!)
    Phil's homegirl, God Jack wanna keep her

    But it's not happenin' neither (No), shake it like a seizure
    Hold on, let me spark this, take a breather (Yeaaah-hahah!)
    Breathe the reefer in my lungs
    I got grapes, what you watching—

    Todokete (<i>Ring out</i>)
    Setsunasa ni wa namae o tsukeyou ka "Snow halation"? (<i>Shall I name this heart-rending pain "Snow halation"?</i>)
    (May yor may yor may may may yor may yor may)

    Now this is a story all about how
    My life got flipped turned upside down
    And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
    (May yor may may yor yor)

    In West Philadelphia born and raised
    On the playground is where I spent most of my days
    Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
    And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
    (May yor may yor may may may yor may yor may)

    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
    Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
    And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
    (May yor may may yor yor)

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    Op, op, op, op, op, op, op, op, op op op op op op (May may may may yor may)

Lyrics: |-
    (Ah, fuck. I can't believe you've done this.)

    (Oh my God!)
    (Oh shit!)
    (Oh, no!)
    (Oh, no!)
    (Shit!)
    (I don't like where this is going.)
    Wash away the anger (Oh my god, we're having a fire! ...Sale. Oh, the burning!)
    Here I stand beneath the warm and soothing rain
    The droplets falling gently down on the terrain (Oh, no!)
    Wash away the sorrow all the stains of time
    (That's right, get noscoped!) But there's no memory it's only dry inside (Get noscooooooped!)

    (Oh, no!) (It's the Nutshack!) In the mud and sinking deeper
    (Oh, no!) (It's the Nutshack!) Into a peaceful life
    And it will come (It's the Nutshack!) (Oh shit!) Like a flood of pain
    Pouring down on me (Oh my God!) (It's the Nutshack!)

    And it will not let up
    Until the end is here (Son of a bitch!)
    And it will come through the darkest day (Smoke weed everyday!)
    In my final hour
    And it will never rest until the clouds are clear (You're going straight to hell!)
    Until it finds my dreams have disappeared

    [MUDA MUDA MUDA] [ORA ORA ORA]

    (NOO GOD! NO. GOD. PLEASE. NO. NO!!! NO!!! NOOOOOO!!!)
    (Ah, fuck. I can't believe you've done this.)

    (I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty.)

    (Every day a million babies are born in the United States alone.) (screams)
    (Many of these babies climb out of vaginas. Others, the storks bring them.) (screams)
    (Some are born out of slime in paradox space, thanks to a special video game your momma used to play.) (screams)
