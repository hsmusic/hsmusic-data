   Consider this an "upgraded" version of the [[track:the-showdown-single-version|"The Showdown"]] track that I released in December of 2022. This is the version of the song that will appear on my next album "Friends Beyond The Ring" (not released yet). End of song references [[track:walk-stab-walk-r-and-e|"Walk Stab Walk"]] by [[artist:erik-scheele|Erik Scheele]].
