    <i>Guffy:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://sahcon.bandcamp.com/track/thats-what-im-classspectin-character-select))

    the title isnt any specific reference, but i wanted something along the lines of who am i expectin' or thats what im expectin' and i just shoved the class in so its like. classpect. class aspect. yknow?

    i was listening to the tony hawk pro skater 3 soundtrack while at work yesterday and just went "oh i love these more down low tracks that arent like heavy rock" and thought, hey that'd be a dope kinda thing while looking at a character select menu.

    also thought about the MVC2 character select theme but it ended up being not too much like it lmao

    got that nice baseline, added a bit of auto wah to it, and mostly left it as the loop bc thats what a bunch of them rap tracks in thps3 are like

    i have NEVER done anything with a wah guitar before. i think its a bit messy, but i both wasnt sure how to do it and didnt have much time before the deadline lmao? deadline is in a few hours as i write this and i started the track maybe 16 hours ago

    it felt super empty without having a rap section in there

    if i could have, i would have found someone to rap SOMETHING over the top and get some dj ass scratches in, but again deadlines. in the end i just whipped out the trusty speak & spell samples and like. counted with it.

    in the back part i got it to spell out every aspect, isnt that neat?

    i wanted to do more with troll themes, but i just kinda shoved a [[track:rex-duodecim-angelus|rex duodecim angelus]] in there by the start and end, while the middle gets [[track:showtime-original-mix|showtime]], [[track:aggrieve|aggrieve]], [[track:beatdown-strider-style|beatdown]] and [[track:dissension-original|dissension]] for the kids.

    the horns were the last moment thing i added, and literally add like 15 minutes onto the load time of the session?? its rough out here in pro tools land. i just wanted something to fill space because it felt empty without it, ESPECIALLY the intro.

    oh yeah theres also an old vinyl sound going in the background bc there was a texture in those thps3 tracks which was missing and this seemed to give it that? it also helped with the spindown at the end lol

    oh also post deadline i added an organ with some [[track:homestuck-anthem|homestuck anthem]] or whatever

    <i>Guffy:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://sahcon.bandcamp.com/track/gale-force-vs-john))

    originally named "jonny boy"

    the characters i feel i woulda been the best at got taken like immediately

    so i took the chance to do something ive wanted to for a while, emulate some kinda yoko shimomura style stuff

    yoko shimomura's work has this powerful, but beautiful sounding piano, and since i'm doing stuff for John this is a good time for piano

    im borrowing bits from [[track:showtime-original-mix|showtime]], [[track:doctor|doctor]], [[track:sburban-jungle|sburban something]], and [[track:harlequin|harlequin]] in places

    there was an electric guitar i had which i felt happy with in the intro but Pro Tools crashed and my backup lost a bunch of changes i had made to it i couldnt recover, so it had to say goodbye :(

    i wanted to involve more stuff with solo strings but i didnt want to push it too far into rose territory. i've also been fucking around with breakbeats and stuff lately so ive had to keep that out of here too lol (edit: i didnt keep it out i had to play with them)

    i got stuck with this track a lot and i feel like you can probably hear it by the way its kinda segmented around where i started playing with motifs and sections from other john-related songs but i'd like to think it works out.

    also endings are HARD sometimes dude.

    <i>Latadenata:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://sahcon.bandcamp.com/track/even-in-battle-vs-rose))

    hey guys, latadenata here to explain the song:

    (sorry in advance for potential english grammar errors!)

    at first it was kind of hard for me to start writing this song, i have never really been a big fan of fighting games so I was kinda new to this “fighting game music style”, making it hard for me to picture how the song would go

    one thing i knew i had to do was using those typical soundfont orchestra hits you can hear in a lot of retro videogame music to give it some intensity just as a real fight would, well i mean, i guess they’re mostly intense idk i have never been to a fight maybe i should try

    the next thing for me was using the two songs i find more recognizable for rose: [[track:even-in-death|Even in death]] and [[track:derse-dreamers|Derse Dreamers]]

    of course, derse dreamers is (allegedly) dave’s theme too, but who looks bigger on the cover art? exactly.

    for both of these songs i pretty much just used their beginning melodies as the main melodies of each part because they’re recognizable and are also hard as fuck.

    i mostly tried to use violins and pianos since those are the two instruments i find most fitting for rose (and also used staccato violins to emphasize intensity and raw epicness)

    for the bass and the even in death main melody i used more retro-like sounds (touhou soundfont bass and a generic square layered with a soundfont piano-y thingy) since i find fighting games are usually generally thought more as 2D retro pixelart games than anything.

    <i>METIANULL:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://sahcon.bandcamp.com/track/hadron-collider-vs-jade))

    Well! I like to think of this as a journey. I wanted to highlight how sometimes in homestuck it’s like you’re constantly jumping into different worlds and your scenery is rapidly changing as you try and sometimes fail to adapt. I imagined this playing in a modern-y fighting game emotional rpg weird lore moment setting. Hopefuly that makes sense to people other than me, LOL

    Fun fact. This song was originally written for aranea, but jade was suggested instead. the more i listen, the more i see the jade ness of everything. That flute at the end ties the knot together for me….

    <i>Tee-vee:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://sahcon.bandcamp.com/track/hopy-orders-be-just-be-heroic-or-be-dead), excerpt)

    A battle theme featuring a bunch of Dirk-centric themes. I've always loved [[Now I'm a Villain]] from Beyond Canon and it was the perfect time for me to do something using bits from this song.

    I didn't have that many references or inspirations making this track, the guitars make it somewhat Daisuke Ishiwatari sounding I suppose but honestly the title I came up with afterwards is the most Guilty Gear inspired thing here actually haha. The middle section was more inspired by the more industrial tracks from Tekken games but I feel like it ended up sounding more like something between Mortal Kombat and Persona 2.

    Except for the guitars, all instruments are either from the Roland Cloud JV-1080 plugin or loops from Distorted Reality, Methods of Mayhem and [[flash:338|Dave's beat machine]].

    <i>Witch's Cadence:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://sahcon.bandcamp.com/track/bloodsucker-brawl-vs-kanaya))

    This song's origin story is a bit bonkers. Just like the song itself, it's messy, it's a little rushed, and it still somehow is kinda cool. I was talking with my buddy [[artist:metianull|metianull]] about homestuck music stuff and then the topic of sahcon came up. He mentioned that he was doing a track for it and then I said something along the lines of "Oh that's cool! I applied but I guess I didn't get in." To which metianull said "WHAT." and mentioned that he'd vouch for me next year. But then I got a little goofy, and said that if the time limit wasn't up, I'd still be down to make something for it if he asked the team leaders. Of course, what I didn't know is that the due date was MIDNIGHT THAT VERY DAY. Eventually I got in through the combination of metianull and [[artist:rainy|rainy]] (legends, the two of them). And buckled the F*** down and started grinding. This song is the result of that, so, lmao.

    It's a kanaya song, and I was recommended to do something gothic for her, so of course there's some church organs. Oh also I played a lot of guitar in this. Some of it is kinda goofy in it's execution but it's whatever. Still really happy with how it turned out even if it was a little rushed, and is kinda messy. But. . .<br>
    I'll take the few wins that I can get!!

    || MIDNIGHT CARNAGE ||

    A song dedicated Jack Noir (D.O.G. Mode)

    I wanted to make a song that makes you feel cool while fighting. So the use of metal guitars + Jazz was a really good choice to evoke that feeling while also fitting into the Jack aesthetic. This is also why I didn't go with a straight version of the [[track:black|"BLACK"]] motif.

    While totally cool, it is a really cheesy pick to go with the really straight forward version of the iconic melody. It needs to make you feel like ANIME IS REAL. So a song that takes that motif and "evolves" it will make you ASCEND to the sky as you wavedash into that bastard. (IDK about fighting game lingo...)

    Oh, and it's also based on [[track:walk-stab-walk-r-and-e|"Walk-Stab-Walk"]] because, of course it would.

    ([[artist:funk-mclovin|Funk]] said it would work with some lyrics, can someone do that pls? thanks.)

    || One Last Strife (16bit) ||

    One of my favorite songs ever, located [[track:one-last-strife|on the 2021 SAHcon album]], is back in a new POWERFUL 16 bit arrangement. (Huzzah!)

    Since this is a fighting game album, it would be a really dumb thing to ignore my own battle theme. I decided to do what most iconic 8bit videogame songs did and evolve, now in POWERFUL 16bit (not really.) The challenge came in the form of making sure it respects the idea and vibes of the original track, a chaotic yet bombastic battle theme. So now it is even more bombastic and chaotic... Maybe I went too far this time.

    I really dig this version. I do hope it becomes someone's favorite track. I do also think I'll have to reuse it somewhere, maybe. Only Time Will Tell.
