    Let me tell you a little story that starts from [[album:cool-and-new-volume-v|Volume V]]. The art team were having an "let's go through our art and see how much it sucks" binge, when I came across my track art for "[[track:i-need-an-abumbalnce-mp3|i need an abumbalnce!!.mp3]]" and saw the LOWAS in the top left corner. The first thing I thought to myself was "hey, I could make that better." And so the editing of the original begins, and I end up with this. After getting a lot of positive reception and people asking me to make other planets, I decided to do this: start (and finish) LOHAC, then move on to LOLAR, then finally LOFAF. Over the course of working on LOHAC (which took too long to make the base circle of) I realized that I wasn't going to do anything with them, effectively making these for no reason. About this time is where I had the idea of arranging them in a Volume 8 cover fashion because, hey, I had the planets, I could do the thing, what's to lose?
    After finishing LOHAC, [[artist:xenozane|XenoZane]] (sup booklet guy) asked me to do LOLAR, and as a joke, I decided to do LOLAF, Rose's CANWC planet instead. That joke was the only reason I had LOLAF handy and decided to do LODAR soon after finshing LOLAR. (and by soon after i mean the same day)
    The same day is when i decided to make a base concept for what I was going to do with these planets that would have no use otherwise. After placing the planets that I had in their positions, more people starting noticing that the art for the planets had no use at the time.
    I made a second concept art the next day.
    On the same day, [[artist:makin|Makin]] noticed the art i was making and said this. Now, for some reason, my brain read that as "you can have the volume 8 spot" for some wild, bizzare, :wackyZany: reason. ((Insider info: the original Volume 8 album art was repurposed into the CaNHS3 album art.))
    For some unknown reason, it took me three days to make LOFAF, and two days later I decided to make a "final plan" that never worked out, and made an 8 for the cover slightly after.
    It took me too long to do the stars, about a week or something like that, but I got them done and that's all that matters. I added the Vrasky not too long after.
    So yeah. That's the story about how a little edit to an old project stemmed into the cover for an album, and a project that I consider one of my best.
    Overall, making the Volume 8 cover was a really fun project, and helping this team (and the team helping me) has been the greatest thing I've experienced in years, maybe ever.
    I hope you have fun (or had fun, if you're reading this retroactively) with the album. Stay safe out there.

    fuck you bob i do not read your commentary because you put so many fucking pictures like goddamn

    I wanted to contribute to the team more than just uploading youtube videos, so i jumped on the opportunity to make a commentary booklet, as i think the previous ones are really funny. problem is: i had no idea how to even make these. i wouldnt have been able to make this without the help of [[artist:interrobang|interrobang]], who sent me the template for the [[album:cool-and-new-homestuck|canh]] commentary booklets and introduced me to adobe indesign.

    (Great, uhh there's good parts of the fandom and then there's this. I'm sitting here like, dude, let's do some comics, let's do some music, let's do some fucking voice act— that's fun. Then it's like hey, uhh, what about we just be super cancerous and uhh, make like a buncha shit. Um, but you have so much other stuff you can do. You have good, like, music people who are willing to do music. But, like w-wh-w-w-wha-what if we made, what if we made memes! I mean, yeah that's fun, but how about some... real stuff? Naaaaaah.... naaah... nah, I like memes. Alright, fine.)

    <i>Wheals:</i> (Composer)
    "This started as a thing I made for my effort to do some music at least once a day for two weeks in winter break. The original goal was to make something house-y (based on the obvious house-home pun), but it instead turned into a weird electronic song that I had no idea what to do with.
    Then S[FRESH JIMMY dropped and I realized ""weird electronic song"" was exactly the genre that I had established as being Jimmy's in Fresh Jimmy's Fresh Beatz. So I continued from the Homestuck Anthem parts to FJFB parts and then a part from... a different anthem."

Commentary: |-
    <i>TirantBacon:</i> (Composer)
    Ah, unintentional touhou. How unintentionally touhou. This unintentionally reminds me of a particular song that ends with touhou and starts with unintentional.
    Making this song was absurdly fun. It was the first time I've really got to make another version of someone else's song, and I enjoyed what I could do with it. It's not a huge song, and especially not a crazy song in any way shape or form. It was just a small idea that ended with me putting it on the album. And yes, it doesn't sound like a touhou song at all. I'm not a mad man, and especially not [[artist:zun|ZUN]] in the slightest :)
    All I can really hope is that you like it as much as I liked making it!

    <i>CreatorOfJanespeak:</i> (Artist)
    If you can't tell, I really like the idea of psychopathic Jhon. Making Hecka Jef shoot time-travel NANCHOS for the totally not intentional again Touhou looks cool too, you hafta admit. (Also, obligatory Rorb is the best part of the track art.)

Commentary: |-
    <i>cryptologicalMystic:</i> (Composer)
    The reason that this song sounds random is that it really is random. I found a sheet music generator online (randomsheetmusic.com, if you must know) and painstakingly typed the output into MuseScore (it was the only one I found that actually worked for what I want, and it didn't support MIDIs). I think my rationale for doing so was half deficiency in original composition techniques (seriously, look at my SoundCloud, it's all remixes, all of it) and half a pretense of "oh, since Hecka Jeff is a corrupt(ed?) character, his music should be corrupt as well" to hide the fact that I really didn't know what I was doing. I don't know why this made it onto Vol. 8 at all, actually.

    <i>cryptologicalMystic:</i> (Artist)
    I have an old version of the track art. It's slightly disturbing in a way incompatible with the idea of the track, which is why it's not the final version. It looks like a dolphin. Not sure why I kept it, except to laugh at.

    This is my [[track:three-in-the-morning-4-1-3-hours-late-remix-canwc-gh|4 1/3 hours late mix]], as a homage to the best two comedians/artists/geniuses vaguely associated to the Homestuck and Cool and New fandoms for some reason. I hope you enjoy the soothing bowtunes and stutzballades together with the electronic Daft Punk shit. The new instrumentals are actually BACK YARD vocoded, but it seems I went too far in distorting them. If you think this is repetitive, the original song is 5 minutes long and has less variety, so don't complain <img src="media/misc/JaedAngery.png" width="24">

    I dont even know what to type here, just throwing some bowman memes with shitty effects and done I guess.

    <i>TirantBacon:</i>
    "this is it the moament youre all been a waiting for
    swet bro had dead
    hecka jeff is angery
    jhon egbret is stutid
    If you've heard the song already before reading the commentary, you'll know it's pretty intense in terms of instrumentation. I wanted this specific song to fit a stunning conclusion to the ""Hecka Jeff wants to kill Jhon Egbret"" saga which is currently being brought up in CaNWC. It actually has an interesting production backstory, involving numerous attempts at trying to conceptualize how this song would be arranged.
    I first made a song of the same name a while back, but I declared it ""too awkward to have it on any proper album"", so I discarded it without hope that I would attempt another version, until the hecka jeff album came around, resulting in a short mediocre publish of what I thought would be a good battle theme at the time. I THEN decided to rework this song from the point I left off of the original, which is why I kept the original intro from the previous version.
    There are many points I'd like to mention about the song, but to keep it short I'd like to say that I really enjoyed making it, and that this song isn't meant to blow anyone's socks off, but it's suppose to tell a story. I feel as if I've come a long way in terms of composition knowledge + production knowledge, and I think this song really shows it well.
    (If you couldn't guess the title is a reference to The Princess Bride, a movie I haven't watch yet! I should totally go watch it.)"

    yay im on this now, also greenhaerden said this: "i cleaned it up a bit in a shitty free paint app on my phone and added a cape."

    "I've wanted to do something with Killed by 8r8k Spider!!!!!!!! for a while, and Vrasky's appearance in the comic was the perfect opportunity to do it.
    ...She hasn't been particularly IM8ORT8ANT in CaNWC since the scene she appeared in, though. Maybe I backed the wrong horse, or in this case, supermassive black hole, on this one."

    <i>Ragzilla:</i> (Composer)
    Cool and new webcomic is the perfect mix of silly joke and actual effort into making silly jokes. I love the Roller Coaster Tycoon joke, and i wanted the "actual effort, but still a silly joke" feel to it. I love making EDM music, so I chose a quick tempo, and just rolled with it. I wanted it to be upbeat, and also happy.

    <i>Makin:</i> (Artist)
    I made this a long long time ago for another song, so long that I have genuinely forgotten which one it was. I think it was a cookiefonster song, but he didn't like this glorious track art, so I had to shelve it. Wheals reminded me that this track was missing art and that mine fit it perfectly, so its time had finally come.
    The track art is based on that one guy from Wacky Zany Races or something. Evil Jhon will always be the best subject for my art.
    tl;dr: fuck you cookie even if it wasn't your song :jaedAngery: Also this track is pretty fucking good, I got lucky.

    <i>William Leonard:</i> (Composer)
    i wanted to make a relatively simple chillout song for the almighty act 3nd character selection screen. that is what i did! it's a lot mellower than most stuff in the canmt discography, but i don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. variety is cool! in the second half of this song, i accidentally shifted the bass section forward 1 measure while i was making it. and it actually sounded great! like a neat spin on the existing bassline. so i kept it like that! probably the most clever thing i have done with my music, which says a lot. exclamation mark!

    <i>William Leonard:</i> (Artist)
    i wonder how the mspa reader would've reacted after not a single moment of interaction in all of cool and new webcomic. he'd probably, like, shoot himself TWICE. cause that's possible

    I spent way too much time on this track in relation to the quality it ended up at. Originally, I just planned on a Sburbian Jungle remix with the Michael Bowman Remix as the backing drum track. When several people pointed out that would be relatively boring, I responded by shoving in a random assortment of other Bowman songs, along with audio clips from some of his videos. The ""I have no ideas"" clips within the piano solo section is meant to reflect how I was basically just placing audio clips semi-randomly at that point.
    Most of the actual instrumentation in this was just me fiddling with various synth presets, and just stacking and stacking them on top of each other. I'm surprised that it ended up as coherent as it did.

    i sent this image to bowman because i realized it would be fitting for a song called [[track:suicide-hotline|suicide hotline]] and he responded with "Thanks! You meme like one of the best." i've never been more proud

    I've always felt these albums could use a bit more of an avant garde side. If it sounds like "normal music", are you even really trying? That said, this song is litterally just notes placed at random on a piano roll. It's about as good as you could expect from that, but the song [[track:o|"o" from volume s*x]] was a much better implementation of that philosophy.

Commentary: |-
    <i>meems:</i> (Composer)
    A.J. McLean once said "Music is love, love is music, music is life, and I love my life. Thank you and good night." Ever since the beginning of time, music has affected the human race in many different ways. Whether it be used for worship services, laxed get-togethers, or frequent meetings of the mind, music has proven to be an effective mediator for many situations in life. We see it used in film scores, popular television broadcasts, unpopular television broadcasts; the limit to the application of music is really limitless. However, what many people do not see is the effort that is put into said songs by the composer. Today, I will be looking at how my song, "Jhon's Lament" exemplifies this lack of knowledge to the consumers by detailing the creation process, describing the emotion that was put into the song, and discussing my satisfaction with the result of the song, when considering the creation process. It was a rainy day in the dreary Southeastern United States. As I was preparing to rest myself, my mind was pierced with the consuming thought of "bitch you gotta write a song for your composition class you're fucked, you cheeky bastard." Frantically, like any reasonable-minded person, I ran into the kitchen and assembled myself a turkey sandwich. I was quite pleased (A/N: The sandwich was quite delicious, if you were wondering). However, that looming threat of failing my composition class penetrated me, like a skewer that is about to perforate the delicate skin of an olive being presented in the form of a delectable kebab. With this in mind, I decided that it was finally time to take action. I reluctantly sat down at my computer and opened Fruity Loops Studio 12.1. I dragged my VST of choice into the Channel Rack, and patiently waited until my fate was decided: It was time to make a song. Dramatically, I powered on my Yamaha P45B keyboard, and opened the piano roll. My hands were sweating. Not due to the threat of failing the semester, but due to the fact that someone probably spiked the turkey that went into my sandwich earlier.  That shit will fuck you up, yo. You gotta be careful where you get that turkey from :eyes_emoji: Anyways, I took a deep breath, spread my cape across my seat, and began to play a melody. Sadly enough, this melody wasn't good enough to be a melody, so I just made it an ostinato. This would later on prove to be very successful in the song, and would be the backbone of sheer art. As I was coming up with a melody, the turkey sandwich must have brought upon some extreme inspiration, because as I was hearing those notes repeatedly play, I assembled a melody. However, this inspiration did not last long, because on the second measure of the melody, the inspiration had left, and I was left with a skeleton of a song. So I did what any good musician would do: Half-ass it and through in some motifs, and I did just that. I broke the bass chord and added in Sburban Jungle. It was music to my ears. I figured I'd go through the chorus of Sburban Jungle and add it the same way that I started it. For originality purposes, I decided to go with everyone's favorite song and rarely-used meme, Flintstones. However, I was presented with a crisis. Flintstones is written in a major key. This song is in a minor. Therefore, I did what any reasonable person would do and put Flintstones in A Minor. It was perfect. The song was complete. I had accomplished my task, with minutes to spare. The last thing to do was to submit the song. The entire process ended up taking 45 minutes, and I was worried about the outcome. Would my teacher know? Would she fail me, anyways? No matter. I was forced to submit it. Within these last few hours, I conceived a thought. "What if I submitted this song to the Cool and New Music Team?" Oh yes. This was a grand idea. The song's name, however, was "River's Lament." That had to be changed. What better idea than to change it to "Jhon's Lament." Oh yes. That was great. The night was complete, I had written a song, even though I was not terribly fond of how the teacher would react. Fast-forward a few days and I am struck with utter surprise. The teacher had given me a perfect score on the assignment, and she even left a little note, too. As I was receiving my report on the song, I looked at the bottom of the paper, where it said, as clear as day, "is that Flintstones at the end? :)"

    Inspired by that one CANWC page where jhon makes a rollercoaster that looks like rose. I converted the first part of Aggreive into 3/4 and then put it together with RCT theme, and decided to use the most carnival instrument i could think of, the calliope. It sat like that for a long while and then cookie added another part to it, which i re-instrumentated.

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Artist)
    All I really did was transcribe more parts of the RCT theme song and the second half of Aggrieve but it was still fun to do.

    I have no skill whatsoever in 2D art. Therefore, you get to experience this grotesque 3D creation of Rose that's reminiscent of a certain Tank Engine.You can also see I also tinted the logo purple, which is about my limit of 2D art.

    <b>WHO LET THAT SAX IN</b>
    I originally planned to make this song totally unrelated to CaNWC as more of a Vriska song then Vrasky song, but I just couldn't resist mixing it up a notch. Vrasky just needed a theme so badly, and how appropriate for an album titled Volume 8 too! I know we haven't actually gotten much to really look at in terms of Vrasky's appearances, but I feel as if this song was right for her in some way (don't quote me on that).
    This song starts off very wonky and out of place, and definitely has no really direction. I made most of the song in a blues scale because that's usually what was running for Vriska. The song then jumps into a major scale, which is what I wanted to represent the fact that Vrasky may not be so evil, besides obviously being kinda demanding during her first appearance, and just darn right misunderstood. There's also a Moshi Moshi reference, which is pretty cool.
    All in all I hope you enjoy listening to this loud, out of control, messy Vrasky themed song that I spent several hours on trying to perfect to the closest degree, AM I IM8ORT8ANT yet?

    "This started as a really old project (originally planned for [[album:cool-and-new-volume-s-x|volume s*x]]!) to make a Rose song based on an original melody I had written and thought sounded pretty nice. That melody still remains, in the final section of the song.
    The song ended up being far more storytelling than I had anticipated, though: it pretty much follows Rose being alone, pestering the shitty trolls, and finally findind Kanaya and leaving with some hope. The title is taken from said pesterlog with Kanaya."

    People liked [[track:fighting-spirit-redux|Fighting Spirit Redux]] so I decided to do another song like that, this time remaking Fighting Spirit Second Form with cool and new motifs. This time I was a lot less self indulgent with picking melodies to use but I got to use some less common ones which was pretty cool and new. My favorite parts of this are Moshi Moshi? and Battle Against an Average Foe. I probably could've used [[track:unintentional-touhou|Unintentional Touhou]] as well but for some reason that didn't occur to me.

    i tried to mimic the original fighting spirit second form art but with the lodar gang. thats about it. hot artists thoughts on this piece: hecka jef looks like gary oak with a fat ass and a blue onesie but honestly im at peace with that idea. also fresh germyquensprit looks like a fucking demon which is rad.

    <i>olegoleg123:</i> (Composer)
    This song was not originally meant for CANWC and/or Homestuck, however, I decided to apply it here because of two reasons: I felt like it would fit Rose fairly well and I wanted this song to become a persistent leitmotif in CANWC(since original, serious leitmotifs is what the CANWC soundtrack is still very much lacking). Later, I made a few candidates for the ""second version"" of this song(Aura of Void(unfinished), [Halloween Track](https://soundcloud.com/olegoleg123/halloween-2016-preview)(unrelated to CANWC), [Dance of Colour](https://soundcloud.com/olegoleg123/dance-of-colour)(didn't really turn out all that good), HQ Remaster(didn't really go anywhere after the first two bars, will possibly be continued and released as and ""Alpha Version""))
    This song is to be used when the comic goes from ""mostly ironically shitty and messing around"" to ""100% dark and serious"", which I'm hoping would happen at some point.

    <i>CreatorOfJanespeak:</i> (Artist)
    I should probably look up guides on how to draw arms and hands. Body-proportion wise, this is one of the best things I've drawn. The colour aura is my personal favourite part of this track art. That's pretty much all there is to say on the matter.

    <i>Griever:</i> (Composer)
    "The new universe that the kids and trolls and even Calliope made their humble abode was, well, utopic. But it wasn't always that way, you know. In the year 4200, 800 years before the time period that Dave took everybody to, a great war broke out over the most petty of ideals and virtues. You see, there were religious scriptures being uncovered as time went on, and the new Earth was slowly globalizing. But conflict arose when some scriptures began to contradict each other in terms of the relationships between the gods. All of a sudden, sects began to gather, rallying around different pairs of their gods. This was how the shipping wars began. Was Dave really ever into Jade all that much? Or was he really getting along with Karkat on a space-trip that only one other man had seen? Davejade, Davekat, it didn't matter. True believers of every ship imaginable perished on the battlefield for their cause. The great shipping wars of 4200 raged for 4 centuries and thirteen years. On October 25th, 4613, civilization was destroyed as a result of defense portals rerouting weapons of mass destruction to nearly every inch of the planet, coincidentally missing the entire meteor, thankfully. The few survivors had to make a pilgrimage to the meteor to jump start society with ectobiology. Those were some of the bravest souls to ever live on this new universe.
    Upon finding out this bit of juicy information, Rose brought it to the attention of John, Dave, and Jade. They shared bittersweet laughs at the absurdity of the war and all the destruction their silly minor childhood crushes and romance-teasing actions had unintentionally caused. And, since they had already gathered for the first time in months, they chose to honor the ones who made the sacrifice to reset the world's society after the great shipping wars. They decided to hold a Deity Concerto in which they played all sorts of music and had a great time, showing the citizens of this new universe the greatest ship of all - friendship. Rose lifted her violin, John placed his hands over the piano. Dave dragged his Phat Beats record mix studio to the stage. Jade got ready to doot on the flute as hard as she could before later switching to bass for half the concert. And they began their opening act, in honor of the war and in honor of the ones that held onto hope for a utopia out of destruction.
    This is that opening act. You're fucking welcome."

    I made this a while back when I was making a bunch of shitty Game Theory thumbnails, and thought I'd make some kind of SBURB Theory series out of it on my channel. That didn't exactly work out and I only used it for a school assignment that was only public on my channel for a short time. This song is also my second contriubution to go on an album and my second midi edit to go on an album. Hopefully the next time you see my name, it'll be accompanied by an original composition.

    This track started as "testing" DVS Saxophone and choir soundfont's abilities to work and over the course of few days became this. And 2 months later I added tubular bells because why not (and also because they fit the theme of this track).

    This is probably the most orchestra bullshit thing I'll ever make, but it's cool finally being able to do a legit song out of the whole Patient/Doctor thing. The flute parts are from a secret song I'm working on that'll probably never be released ever. Not really but it's fun to pretend.

    (I'm so fresh you can... genitals... ahhhh)

    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Well come on, get ready, get set, and here we go

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying (Adrien Brody Adrien Brody A-Adrien Bro-bro-brobrody)
    You've gotta be ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing (Adrien Brody Adrien Brody A-Adrien Bro-bro-brobrody)

Commentary: |-
    <i>TirantBacon:</i> (Composer)
    Also ~~not~~ known as Dabe's theme (no or yes????????????????????? u decide)
    Dabestep's melody was something I initially came up with on the piano as a concept melody, which eventually got transcribed as a proper song. It originally didn't sound this solid and full on, with it instead being more of a typical light chiptune that I didn't plan to go anywhere further with. Eventually, due to choice, I made the triangle wave louder and the drums louder still, which you can hear in the original version.
    [[artist:kusoro|Xoro]] heard the song, added drums plus bitcrushing at transition points, and this is the result. I got to say, he improved the song completely, as the drums go very well with the arrangement of the overall tune. He did a great job knowing what rhythm the drums would have! The original version is on the soundtest, if that interests you.

    <i>Kusoro:</i> (Composer)
    I heard Tirant's song and added an intro and punchier drums, that's pretty much it.

Both these were titled EmeliaKLoVania, referencing the author of Conflict! and had some TTS at the start. Since the joke has worn out, I removed the TTS and changed the title, besides doing general improvements.

    A while back, around when I first joined the team, people noticed that [[artist:discfortune|"Cryptanark"]] and "cryptologicalMystic" both have "crypt" in them. Obviously this meant that we should do a collab. Due to various factors, this ended up manifesting as "me making a remix of his latest song, which happened to be Unintentional Touhou". There's not much else to say.

Commentary: |-
    <i>CogentInvalid:</i> (Composer)
    Frogs were invented in 1812 by William "William" Haversley, a British aristocrat and amateur astrophysicist best known for his bold assertion, in a research paper published in the Oxford Journal of Natural Philosophy in summer 1808, that the holes visible on the moon's surface were signs of a vast sublunarian tunnel system dug out by a long-extinct race of giant space worms and not, as the conventional wisdom of the time had it, caused by the gaseous excretions of propionibacteria. This claim, being in direct contradiction with the teachings of the Catholic Church, had him branded a heretic, and a hefty price was put on his head - the reward for his capture so valuable that by some accounts, the Pope himself snuck into Haversley's bedchambers in the middle of the night in an attempt to assassinate the man, only to find a wax dummy lying in bed and the man himself hours into a long voyage to Bermuda, where he would spend the rest of his life in exile. Life in Bermuda was comfortable, if lonely, and Haversley spent many an evening sitting on the beach watching the sunset and contemplating the many sorrows of his life - until one day when, having had enough of the solitude, he became determined to build the perfect companion for himself, putting all of his scientific knowledge to the test. For months he laid out detailed plans for his creation, accounting for every organ in the creature's body, every stitch in its recycled skin, every bolt in its artificial skeleton (this was, by the way, several years before the publication of Mary Shelley's seminal work Frankenstein and, therefore, predated the popular grave-robbery-and-monster-assembly craze brought about by trend-obsessed plebians). Finally his plans were perfected, and he began to set them in motion - only to discover that he had a severe dearth of biomass to work with, given that the custom among native Bermudans was to cremate their dead and scatter them to the winds rather than dump them someplace convenient like a graveyard. Haversley therefore had to make do with what he could find - a handful of fish scooped out of a nearby swamp, the occasional squirrel - with a heaping of algae lending both raw cellular material and a distinct green hue to the creature's skin. In the end, it came out looking little like the hominid simulacrum he had intended, but his creation, the very first frog, was nevertheless an incredible achievement: an invasive species that crowded out the surrounding ecosystem, spread unstoppably, and still terrorizes us even today.

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Composer)
    One day I thought, hey I wonder how well Death by Glamour sounds combined with Conflict. This idea started as a simple high quality rip concept but it turned into this monstrosity of a song instead. Instead of transcribing the original song precisely except for melodies to replace with Conflict, I added a lot of my own doodling and interpretations of parts. Thanks to [[artist:pipko-fanfare|dragonChaser]] for helping with harmonizing that high piano part. In the later parts of the song I decided to use Tick to replace [[track:metal-crusher|Metal Crusher]] which it was supposedly based on, and Snow Halation in the sax part because I don't need to explain why. I'm firmly convinced that last part is better than the original, and not even just because of DVS Sax.
    I think this is one of the best songs I've ever made, but let's be real here, it's only because the original Death by Glamour is so good. Still, people liked [[track:fighting-spirit-redux|Fighting Spirit Redux]] well enough so whose tastes am I to judge.
    Also this song will never live up to [[track:sbowban-glamour|Sbowban Glamour]], sorry folks.

    if it isn't clear i fucking hate pheromosa, so let's give some background.
    so one day there's a tournament on smogon and it's ""random monotype"" and i sign up for shits and giggles not expecting to win. first round: fighting vs. flying, with me being flying. ""oh lmao fucking easy"" i think.
    then the piece of shit pulled out a pheromosa and shit hit the fan for me.
    for you who don't care for competitive very much, basically the only way to run pheromosa is with ice beam due to 4x weakness to flying. also, pheromosa is fucking stupidly fast for its attack, with the only real weakness being able to tank a hit. the fucking piece of shit cockroach swept my team completely because like half the team were first route birds and my strongest member being landorus, a ground/flying.
    tl;dr pheromosa prevented me from getting what should've otherwise been a ""ggez"" win

    <i>Wheals:</i> (Composer)
    Unlike [[track:fresh-jimmy-anthem|Anthem]], this was made from the start as a Fresh Jimmy song, at least partially with the goal to use Good Grievous Bodily Harm, it being the other canon Jimmy leitmotif. Also unlike Anthem, the musical genre is intentionally very far away from FJFB. Originally this was going to be a remix of You're So Rad (an unfinished Malcolm Brown track) called You're So Fresh, but I ended up going in (or at least aiming for) a style closer to classical orchestral music than the movie-score style of You're So Rad. There are a still one or two elements borrowed from You're So Rad, but few enough that the name had to be changed. So, I decided to maximize on the silliness of the genre shift...

    Y'know, I probably should've thought of a better title

    <i>Scarodactyl:</i> (Artist)
    This is an awesome song!  Normally I prefer to do track art completely with hand-placed pixels, but what I had in mind for this invited a different hybrid approach (I didn't have much time and it's faster).  From the moment I first read CaNWC it brought me back to the old sprite comic scene so I really wanted to include a tribute to that.  Unfortunately I've kind of lost the knack for bad sprite edits since those days so I recruited the most qualified bad pixel artist I knew to help me with Jhon and Jaed.

    because it's a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcJpoAOPxTw), i decided to whip up a cool 50s scifi horror film poster thing for the track art! it's probably much more dramatic and cool than the actual trailer is, though.

    <i>Wights End:</i> (Composer)
    I first started work on this song after listening to the really bass heavy section in the original at 1:20 and thinking "Hey, Waters of Nazareth would be cool here" I don't care for the intro section that uses the motif from my song Misery Loves Company. It doesn't have the grandure that I wanted to achieve, but I didn't really know how to improve it. In retrospect I would probably have referenced a different song. I tried to reference Cool and New Webcomic music motifs as much as possible, but I also included a few others for shits and giggles or because a certain part of the song reminded me of it. I also tried to use iconic soundfonts and VSTs such as DVS Sax (Used in [[Black]]), Zunpets ([[artist:touhou-project|Touhou]] Trumpets), Earthbound Overdriven Guitar (Used in MeGaLoVania) And two string soundfonts from Hopes and Dreams and [[Upward Movement (Dave Owns)|Upward Movement]]. My favorite part is the mashup of Michael Bowman Remix and a U.N. Owen Was Her acapella; and my least favorite part is the transition right after that. I really like Ska music so a lot of the parts of my song are inspired by it. All and all, I'm happy with the song, though there are some things I would have done differently in retrospect.

    this was originally for the [Credits video(s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UTMPTX45F8) of CANH, but we went with the [[track:revisit-rewind|other]] [[track:resend|two]] instead
    it actually syncs up with the original Credits video, because i thought [[track:ascend|Ascend]] didnt do enough of that, but what resulted was a more of a typical [[artist:cecily-renns|JJR]] mess, which im very happy with

    Missing some more flute ornamentation, dynamics aren't poppy enough, strings are plucked too quickly for real people, but fuck you I made a joke and it's funny and the song sounds like the 50s:

    <i>WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES:</i> (Composer)
    The title is only a half truth. This track was made 30 minutes before the deadline, but that the deadline when we intended to release this album around Christmas. I'm not changing the name however. This track was pretty much just me mutilating an earlier crappy Showtime piece I made for the /r/homestuck community rewrite, randomly placing dvs sax notes over it, and then recording myself coughing into my laptop microphone.
    I didn't originally intend for my sister to interrupt me around the end, but that ended up being funnier than what I originally planned to do, so I kept it in.

    This track was originally going to be my take on the [[album:cool-and-new-homestuck-2|CANHS]] credits contest. It was supposed to be the introduction for it, but I ran out of ideas for the next part so I turned it into a standalone song for volume 8.

    this was originally for rose's violin refrain but i fucked up so massively that the art had to be repurposed
