    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    i'ts album fro cool and new web comic
    its the 1th one

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    There's so much to be said about the absurd trajectory of the Cool and New Music Team, but I'll try to keep it short.

    After the release of the incredible [[album:homestuck-vol-10]], which was a sort of epitaph to the official music team, [a Q&A stream was held with the musicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJWqqikd6S0). There was a bittersweet tinge to it, not just because of Homestuck's recent ending, but because they reflected on their artistic trajectories and how they had been musical amateurs that had been able to refine and hone their skill through the comic's run. To me at least they had always felt like inimitable performers, even if I'd always aspired to be as good as them or as the high-quality fan music that was being made at the time. But their encouraging talk about how they had progressed as artists over the years led to an idea formed right there, in the livestream chat. Why not make our <i>own</i> music team?

    A music team on our own terms, expressly as a practice vehicle, to create and release music without a care in the world as to whether it was good or bad or terrible? No shame, no hesitation, just for the hell of making Homestuck fanmusic, and maybe improving along the way. Cool and New Web Comic's popular but low-quality presentation was a natural fit. And the response was massive. It turned out many people felt the same way, or simply wanted to see what all the noise was about.

    Only two weeks later, the newly-created Cool and New Music Team released a 50-track album. This is that album.

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    The only piece of Homestuck fanmusic I had ever completed was this [Famitracker remix of Flare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AxgMI6451M), but since at the time we were fully committing to the 'shitty music' idea, and a straight up transcription of a Homestuck track isn't particularly CaNWC-ish anyways, I ran it through a bunch of filters. Just to make sure no one accidentally liked it.

Lyrics: |-
    (My name is Constable "Meat Cubes" Houston, I will eat five BIG FUCKING SHIT-FILLED ADULT hat stores in one humdrum summer day, and then my crippling addiction to pornography will be buried alive.)

    (My name is Constable "Meat Cubes" Houston, I will eat five BIG FUCKING SHIT-FILLED ADULT hat stores in one humdrum summer day, and then my crippling addiction to pornography will be buried alive.)

    BOO, BOO, here come de ghost
    I'm de voodoo priest from de skeleton coast
    Trick-or-treat, trick-or-treat, you'll be stomping your feet
    'Cause I'm sugarcane sweet with a Kingston beat

    WHOA-OA-OA-OA watch out, here come de ghoul
    I be spittin' out rhyme while you playing de fool
    I'm a treetop monsta, dat dance all rasta
    Going back to de island for de sticky-sweet ganja

    (I'm THINKING of a number. Between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be 720. I'm THINKING of a number. Between 450 and 850. Do you know what it is? It happens to be 720. Which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number I'm thinking. Is between 450 and 850.)

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the best thing about morning
    Those colorful enchanting little specks
    They make my taste buds spring to life without the slightest warning
    In a way they never do when I eat Chex

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the breakfast I've been cravin'
    I shove 'em by the fistful in my trap
    They got vitamins and nutrients and even riboflavin
    And make Cocoa Puffs look like a bowl of crap

    Yeah Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are a breakfast taste sensation
    They're tiny tasty munchable and sweet
    I'd like to start a bloody war and build a Pebbles nation
    And murder every other breakfast treat

    And the gallows will sway through the night
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    All cereals bow down in fright
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Sycophants and cowards flee
    From Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Captain Crunch on bended knee
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    The balance of the world's askew
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Promise revolutions new
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    What cereal 'mongst other things
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Stays crunchy in the blood of kings?
    It's Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    (My compulsive masturbation, Sullivan! You and me, and my erectile dysfunction, Sullivan! Then I paint all the surfaces of the eggs, Sullivan! It's a mirror collage, Sullivan! DETROIT! THE PASTA CITY! The place was Russia. The year, was 1917. You're under arrest! Just kidding! I now have two complete sets of human teeth
    in

    my

    ([Video of the track being 'recorded live', as it were.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLEzMa1gJTg))

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    It's depressingly common for collaborative fandom albums to run into trouble getting art delivered for all their tracks in time. I don't really blame them, drawing is hard enough without knowing that it's probably going to be playing second fiddle to the music anyways. But nevertheless I knew I could phone this one in without any artistic skill, so I took it off the un-arted song pile. The secret is: there's actually an online tool that generates Minecraft logo-style text.
Lyrics: |-
    (Um, hi. I've made a uh, piece of fanmusic for the um... new and cool webcomic, as you can see it's um, made in... Minecraft. I um, a— a bit about the piece, I um, sort of imagined it as being a um, theme song for the... entire you know, story um, oh I guess the um, word "Anthem" describes that. I guess I'll call it "Anthem" then... yeah let's um, play.)

    (Alright um, you can probably still hear me and that would interrupt the um, music, I'll mute myself... yeah.)

    (I um... hope you enjoyed my music. Yeah, bye.)

Lyrics: |-
    I'm THINKING of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? The number I'm thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It's between four fifty and eight fifty. And it still happens to be between my buttocks. The higher this number is that's between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. Do you know what this number is? It's my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab it for me? I'm thinking that it's seven hundred and twenty, and that it's between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab it? It's a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and get it? I'm thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won't you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won't you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it's between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number that could save you a lot of money. It's between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and it is between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. It could save you a lot of money. A lot of money between my buttocks! But I'm thinking that this number is between four fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number is, although the highest can be eight hundred and fifty, the better chance you have of saving a lot of money. This number is between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. Hopefully this number is greater than four fifty and less than eight fifty. Otherwise it might not be your credit score! My credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which as you all have noticed, is between four fifty and eight fifty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Fortunately, seven hundred and twenty is this number, because it is between four hundred and fifty and eight hundred and fifty. But I'm thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be between my buttocks, and it could save you a lot of money. The higher this number between my buttocks is, the more money it could save you! I'm thinking of a number though, that is between my buttocks. It is still seven hundred and twenty. Won't you reach in and grab seven hundred and twenty for me? Don't grab four fifty or eight fifty, as these are the two extremes. These are not my free credit score. My free credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but I'm thinking that you can reach in and grab it because it is between my buttocks. The number between my buttocks happens to be, well, I'm thinking that it's seven hundred and twenty. But I could be wrong. Because your number could be anywhere between four fifty and eight fifty. I'm THINKING of a number...

    This is just a SBaHJ panel with a bunch of filters run over it like a steamroller. I was aiming to emphasize the resemblance to 'The Scream'. I don't even remember what I did to that poor SBaHJ panel at this point, but I'm sure those emotions made their way into the final product.

    When [[artist:o]] sent in his 'songs' in a surprise show of appreciation for our musical efforts, I immediately nabbed the art spots for them, because I wanted the 'honor', I guess. In any case, I'd say my skill at creating track art was roughly on par with o's skill at creating music, so I guess it worked out fine. You just don't get that kind of rail wobbliness from a lesser artist, you know.
Lyrics: |-
    Everybody get up it's time to slam now
    We got a real jam goin' down
    Welcome to the Space Jam
    Here's your chance, do your dance
    At the Space Jam
    Alright

    Come on and slam, and welcome to the jam
    Come on and slam, if you wanna jam

    Hey you, watcha gonna do
    Hey you, watcha gonna do
    Hey you, watcha gonna do
    Hey you, watcha gonna do

    Party people in the house let's go
    It's your boy "Jayski" a'ight so
    Pass that thing and watch me flex
    Behind my back, you know what's next

    To the jam, all in your face
    Wassup (Wassup), just feel the bass
    Drop it, rock it, down the room
    Shake it, quake it, space kaboom!

    Just work that body, work that body
    Make sure you don't hurt nobody
    Get wild and lose your mind
    Take this thing into over-time

    Hey DJ, turn it up
    QCD, gon' burn it up
    C'mon y'all get on the floor
    So hey, let's go a'ight

    Everybody get up it's time to slam now
    We got a real jam goin' down
    Welcome to the Space Jam
    Here's your chance, do your dance
    At the Space Jam
    Alright

    Wave your hands in the air if you feel fine
    We're gonna take it into overtime
    Welcome to the Space Jam

    C'mon and run, baby run
    C'mon, c'mon, do it, run baby run
    Yeah, you want a hoop, so shoot, baby shoot
    Oh, it's time to hoop, so shoot, baby shoot

    C'mon and slam, and welcome to the jam

    C'mon and slam, if you wanna jam

    Slam, bam, thank you ma'am
    Get on the floor and jam
    It's the QCD on the microphone
    Girl you got me in the zone

    C'mon, c'mon and start the game
    Break it down, tell me your name
    We the team, I'm the coach
    Let's dance all night from coast to coast

    Just slide, from left to right
    Just slide, yourself enlight
    QCD, drop the base

Lyrics: |-
    Four, three, two, fuck you

    Listen up y'all, this shit is ironic
    Strider's beats are best suited to stroll— trolls hooked on phonics

    Karkalicious definition, makes Terezi loco
    She wants to know the secrets that she can't taste in my photo
    Dyin' just to know the flavor, I ain't doin' her no favors
    No reasons why I tease her flush just comes and goes like seasons

    I'm Karkalicious, so delicious
    No I don't do kismesis
    And if you read any fanfics
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses... mwah?
    Don't matter if we're just moirails
    Trolls be lining down the veil
    For a chance to fill a pail

    Four, three, two, fuck you
    So delicious... super sweet
    So delicious, fuckin' adorabloodthirsty
    So delicious, even Egbert wants a piece of me
    I'm Karkalicious, el el el el el el, like candy, candy

    Karkalicious def
    Karkalicious def
    Goddammit, Doctor Scratch stop fucking around with my mic

    Karkalicious definition, makes the shippers crazy
    And Nepeta's always squealing cute pet names like Karkitty
    I'm K to the A, to-a-k— R, K, the A, the T
    And the majority of pairings had better include me

    I'm Karkalicious, so delicious
    My body stays vicious
    All the highbloods feelin' nervous
    'Cuz I'm doing some fitness

    Zahhak's my witness
    Bet that ship curls Nepeta's tail
    And he'll be needing all the towels
    'Cuz I'mma make him sweat pails

    Four, three, two
    So delicious... super sweet
    So delicious, fuckin' adorabloodthirsty
    So delicious, even Egbert wants a piece of me
    I'm Karkalicious, now you nooksuckers hold the fuck up, check it out

    Baby, baby
    If you really want me
    Honey get some patience
    Maybe then you'll get a taste

    I'll be tasty, tasty
    I'll be laced with lacey
    It's so tasty, tasty
    It'll make you crazy

    T to the A, to the S-T-Y, fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-Y, fuckin' tasty
    D to the eh-E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    D, to the E, to the, to the, to the— I'll just spell it out for you

    All the time I turn around trolls gather round, always sniffin' at me wanna guess the color of my blood
    I just wanna say it now [incoherent mumbling] I just don't want you to know
    And I guess I'm coming off as just a little insecure although I keep on repeating how the secret's fucking awesome
    But I'm tryin' to tell, it's a secret that I just don't wanna tell

    Terezi says I smell, delicious so delicious
    No I don't do kismesis
    And if you read any fanfics
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses, mwah
    Don't matter if we're just moirails
    Trolls be lining down the veil
    For a chance to fill a pail

    Four, three, two, fuck you, my body stays vicious
    Zahhak's been feeling nervous 'cuz I got down to business
    Nepeta's my witness, meow, I'll even let her first ship sail
    Just watch that kitten be the first in line to fill a pail

    So delicious, Eridan see
    So delicious, you can trust me
    So delicious, I'll help you be
    I'm Karkalicious, li-li-like candy, candy

    It's so delicious, ey ey ey ey
    So delicious, ey ey ey ey
    I'm Karkalicious she says my blood is like candy, candy

    T to the A, to the S-T-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the— to the— to the— to the—

    To the D to the E, to the— the L-I-S-C-U-O-S
    To the D to the E, to the L-I-S-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the L-I-S-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the— now wait just a motherfucking second!

    (Do I seriously have to spell this shit until the end of the fucking song, I mean whoever fucking wrote the original never had access to spellcheck I guess, because T-A-S-T-E-Y does not spell TASTY, was this Fergie duf-douchemuffin illiterate or something, what do you mean human rap artists are the only ones brave enough to write their own grammatical train wrecks and call it music, what the fuck even is Will Smith doing, he doesn't throw down sick fires anymore? Fuck this shit I quit.)

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    I- ok. I can explain, okay?

    This is an oblique reference to the album [[album:medium]]. When it was initially released, there was a lot of speculation, particularly on the MSPA Forums, around the idea of combining or layering the different tracks on the album to find cool mashups, particularly the matching song pairs for each Land. It was even implied that this was a specific musical choice by [[artist:clark-powell]], to make 'hidden' music (she immediately denied this, but it had no effect). Ultimately it culminated in the creation of 'Medium - Mega Mix', which was for all intents and purposes all eight tracks in the album sandwiched on top of one another into an ungodly sound wall, which was nevertheless positively received by fans. This worthless shitpost of a song is based on that phenomenon, as well as being a sort of 'tribute' to [[album:homestuck-vol-10]] which had after all been the insipration to establish CaNMT in the first place.

    Also in a way, getting the obvious unfunny ear torture shitposts out of the way early on meant subsequent CaNMT musicians would be forced to innovate. So, in a sense, you're welcome?

Lyrics: |-
    (I give up. I've been trying to make this track for... a week now, and... that's all I got. Practically nothing.

    Do you people realize how little music Jade has to begin with? She really only has [[Gardener]] and [[Dissension (Original)|Dissension]], the two songs you just heard. To take those, remix them into a workable song, add my own stuff, and then deliberately make it sound shitty to fit in with the rest of the Cool and New Web Comic... That, I, that's not really an excuse, other musicians have done far more with far less... the rest of this album is proof enough of that.

    I guess what it comes down to, is that... I'm not just not as good of a musician, or, really, artist of any way. I don't have talent. I think Hussie said something like "it actually takes a large amount of skill to get Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff to the perfect amount of shittiness"... and I don't have the drive or talent or skill to do that, or really anything.

    I mean... I did take piano composition classes through middle school but... I haven't done anything since then so... it's almost as if I'd done nothing. And here I am in the middle of a team of people who are actually... putting effort into making good — if difficult to listen to — music, and... I'm left wondering exactly what I can bring to the table.

    ...Nothing, really. I've thought long and hard about it, and... that's my answer. Nothing. I guess there's only one thing left to do.

    "To: Cool and New Web Comic Music Team. Subject: Resignation. Body: I regret to inform you that I will no longer be creating music with all of you. Good luck in the future, I'm out." Guess I'm really doing this, huh?

    I'm THINKING of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money... and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty.
