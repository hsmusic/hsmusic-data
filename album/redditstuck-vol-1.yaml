    <i>Redditstuck:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://redditstuckmusic.bandcamp.com/album/redditstuck-vol-1))

    Please don't pay the ridiculous price for this album. The price is simply a jest - a pyramid scheme beyond even our imagination.

    <i>Nicholas Nakano:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 7/14/2016)

    That's some nice tunes. What sound font is it, or how did you make it?

    <i>Emelia K.:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 7/15/2016)

    fami module, 2a03 classical

    <i>olkiswerve:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 9/24/2016)

    what a cool and new song

    <i>Emelia K.:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 9/25/2016)

    you're really making me wish canwc never used this

    <i>Minish:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 10/7/2016)

    olki's actually a team member, its just a joke

    <i>Emelia K.:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 10/7/2016)

    jokes are great

    <i>Mathias Ramalho:</i> ([SoundCloud comments](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 2/11/2017)

    I thought this was made by the [[group:canmt|Cool and New Music Team]].<br>
    Did you based your track on it?

    <i>Emelia K.:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 2/12/2017)

    i made this, this was made for redditstuck, it was used in redditstuck, and the canwc people spun it off into their own abhorrent joke of largely their own accord

Lyrics: |-
    (Haha... yeah, here's a little something for you'll bustas, yeah. Haha, yeah, boy, \*coughs\*)

    What's up with that?
    You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
    What's up with that?
    You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

    Hater, you don't even smoke crack
    Bitch, you's a mark fool
    Motherfuck that ho shit, pass a G that stem
    I'm about to blaze up, 'specially when it's after dinner
    I changed the game, don't get it misunderstood
    Hitting it out the glass and that smoke all good
    Can't water it with green, get work, got that stick
    The laws[?] know I keep it, they on my dick, these - sick
    But when I do smoke some green
    I'm straight out that rose, you best believe
    But green ain't better than that hard, hard is so much fun
    Seven for forty-five, wholesale gets it done
    And I don't care if you judge me
    I'm smoking cooked, ah I read the wrong line, hold up
    I don't care if you judge me
    I'm smoking cooked, and living so lovely
    So stop looking like you're dumb
    You know you wanna try, but scared to get some

    What's up with that?
    You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
    What's up with that?
    You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

    I'm blazin' white, it's on and poppin'
    I'm blazing white, now my destiny ain't stopping
    I'm coming up in a song to rap
    I sold my soul to Satan, but bought it back from God with this song
    Y'all bustas ain't ballin'
    Unless you smoke some work and see who really paper callin'
    Y'all fallin' off like the last century
    No respect from me till you get that cheese
    And see what life is all about
    And you just a little bitch with a raised snout
    I gets my- oh, we're, uh, we're out of rap, uh... oh.
