    Like with [[album:made-up-yume-nikkis]], the specific duration-crops for each track are unofficial; the original cut has all tracks in sequence. Formatting for the track names is also unofficial, though they come from the vocals, of course.

Lyrics: |-
    Okay, since you
    <big><i>FREAKS</i></big>
    Think that, all my music sounds like Touhou
    I have no choice, but to play
    Improvised Touhou music
    That doesn't actually exist

    This is obviously, the title screen
    It's called
    Girls Pretty Dress Dress ~ Do Your Best Now

    And uh, basically it just has that Asian scale
    That's in every single title screen, um
    I made it up in five seconds
    That's really all I have to say about this one

    I'm choosing Lunatic mode 'cause I'm not a baby

    "girl's, girls' or girls" it's like the only way to know which one it is if it's written down (which, it's not on the tumblr post, tumblr post just has the album title and title, stage 1, and boss 1), but of course-

    but also they all sound the same when pronounced!

Lyrics: |-
    This first level song is called Magical Hopalong Cassidy Station.

    This part of the song is just to remind you that it takes place in Japan, in case you forgot.

    This is where we have the sudden transition into the miniboss battle part of the song.

    <i>YOU ACTIVATED MY SPELL CARD, YUGI</i>

    Okay I'm flying toward the ends of the level now.

    Picking up some more uh, powerups.
    I have not reached max power yet 'cuz it's the first level.

    Now it's coming to a sort of break in the music while you're talking to the boss.

Lyrics: |-
    <i>AN APPLE DISASTER!!</i>
    That's the name of her song
    And her name is Apple Girlington
    She's the personification of
    An apple

    This spell card is called <i>THE APPLE WIZARD OF MOUNT FUJI</i>
    It's part of important Japanese folk lore
    The pre-battle dialogue goes like this:

    <i>You should taste my wonderful apples</i>
    <i>No, sorry, I'm watching my weight recently</i>
    <i>No!! You have to try the apples or I won't let you through!</i>
    <i>Oh, well, I'll give you a diabetes won't I</i>
    <i>[UNTRANSLATABLE JAPANESE IDIOM]</i>

    Then you have a weird chord change
    Because it's a newer Touhou song

    Then they make a joke about apple pie

    Like [[track:girls-pretty-dress-dress-do-your-best-now|girls/girl's/girls']] (and the "~" there), the punctuation here is unofficial. It appears to originate alongside [[track:fruitjam]] from LOFAM4, whose references on Bandcamp and in the album booklet list "An Apple Disaster!!". The music wiki historically inherited this name from the UMSPAF albums' reference lists on NSND.

    Other sources refer to this track with a host of different names, such as:

    - An Apple Disaster (an arranger, Pryncess Sylvsprit's [music website](https://melodymonarchy.com/oldindex))

    Officially (or as officially as you can get), it's just "boss 1".
