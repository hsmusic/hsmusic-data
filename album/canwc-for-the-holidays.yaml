Lyrics: |-
    A shining light so bright on the Internet
    Wriggling with shittiness ever so said
    Made by a man who is golly damn right
    I'm talking to you [[artist:o|o]] on behalf of the web site

    And when you see us shit out crappy complete guaranteed
    A musical shitfest that only I can plead
    We want to say thanks for making it right when it's wrong
    And making it mostly sometimes wrong when it is right

    So relax yourself, you deserve it of course
    Thinking of everything you made in retrospective discourse
    Or should I say [[artist:o|o]] course because the F is paid to respect
    When obviously what else would you even expect

    Happy holidays, I hope you get gifts higher than the high you even have be in order to be that guy
    When a guy like you comes right around it so often looked like a mystery, a riddle, wrapped in a... TV
    So when I say thanks, and on behalf of us all, we mean it well, I mean look at it all
    With all the memes accumulating as one, we wanna say thanks a ton for being there to answer our prayers
    While the Huss man eats his toblerone, and the internet gives him swears

    (Hey uh... drop a beat, [[artist:tirantbacon|Tirant]].)
    (Mmm. Mm-mm-yeah, that's— that's a nice beat. Okay, here we go.)
    Every day when I open the link to Homestuck
    I always feel a little-little twinge, a little twinge of conksuck
    But now the [[artist:o|o]] man's come to answer our prayers
    He's fresher than the fucking Fresh Prince of Bel-Air

    Updating his brand new comic, as cool as he can be
    Showing the absolute fuck out of that hack called Hussie
    So what I'm saying [[artist:o|o]], is that I appreciate your flavour
    And that you'll now be known
    As the Homestuck reader's saviour
    (Mm.)

    They say it's a Homestuck sequel
    This shit's even tighter than Prequel
    Even if you're as furry as [[artist:svix|Svix]]
    Cool and New make the perfect mix
    Even [[artist:bill-bolin|Bolin]] in his confessional
    Admits there is none more professional
    And the Scottish composer [[artist:malcolm-brown|Malcolm]]
    Weeps at this writing smoother than talcum
    Every morning with my bacon
    I'll go and salt alongside [[artist:makin|Makin]]
    Now it seems my salt is gone
    Cured, perchance, by [[artist:o|o]] and Jhon
    [Unintelligible]

    (Here's some... uh quality content from [[artist:cecily-renns|JohnJMemes]].)

    Hey!
    We're Cool and New, hey!
    We're Cool and New!

    Now listen closely
    Here's a little lesson for webcomics
    This is going down as the best gimmick
    If you wanna be like [[artist:toby-fox|Toby]] Cool and New
    You have to catch Andrew Hussie on the cue

    Just follow my memes, and shit around
    Be careful not to post those leaks

    (ARG)
    (No, don't post that!)

    We're Cool and New, hey!
    We're Cool and New!
    We're Cool and New!

    (Hahaha!)
    Now look at this song, that I have made
    When I hit play, be ready to quake!
    (Random screaming.)
    Uh, let's try something else

    Now watch and learn, here's the deal
    You slip and slide on this banana peel!
    (Hahaha ha ha ha... ha.)

    Hey!

    We're Cool and New, hey!

    (How long can he go on like this?)
    (I don't know. He's never tried to sing Cool and New Web Comic version... entire concept parody [Unintelligible])

    We're Cool and New, hey!

    We're Cool and New!

    We're Cool and New, hey!

    We're Cool and New!
    We're Cool and New!
    We're Cool and New, hey hey!

    (We are Cool and New... we are number one.)

    (Back to [[artist:tirantbacon|Tirant]].)
    Okay that was silly
    And I kind of admit these doritos are getting
    Kinda chilly (Hot you dunkass!)

    Our appreciation for this webcomic is more than Cool and New
    That's right [[artist:o|o]] we're still talking to you
    It's about an ignited fixation of concentration causation
    That results in the fiery blazin' of fandom inflation
    Without the Cool and New, our thoughts of it all would be way past due
    And our interested infested uh re-rearranged contested ideas got molested
    By a man with all the fame and bold calamity
    And then taken over by lame and old insanity
    A wicked tyrannity

    And it makes people say
    [[artist:o|o]] my god

    [[artist:o|o]], reading off the script right now
    I think you're the guy that everyone knows how
    The-here's-you're... dude who's made a lot of shit come true
    And you're rocking the shitfest that is Cool and New
    So when I say thanks, I mean it well
    Ju-judging by the fact that we're pretty much still here lel
    Near enough it's been amazing adventure
    And even when Cool and New Web Comic's ended it will be quite the quencher
    Goodbye, I hope you have a Merry... Merry Halloween
    And from everyone on the Cool and New Web Comic, um, Music Team, we wish you all the best!
    (Thank you for Cool and New Web Comic! You're great dude! Goodnight.)

Lyrics: |-
    Twas the night before gristmas—how apropros.
    Not a creature was stirring, not even Swet Bro.
    The hams were hung from the door by the lawn
    in hopes that Rose's virginity soon would be gone.
    Dabe Stidrer was nestled all snug in the chest
    stark naked, revealing his back and his breast.
    Femora with his handcuffs and Dad with his cakes
    had just settled into a car with no brakes.
    When in the backyard there arose such a clatter,
    they drove over there to see what was the matter.
    Away rolled the car as they drove far too fast,
    and into the lake, which was really quite vast.
    But behind them, they saw, as they sank down below,
    a huge rollercoaster (which made them go woah).
    And, what to their wondering eyes then emerged,
    but a cart flying towards them—they were quickly submerged.
    They climbed out of the car and crawled onto the lawn,
    and they knew then and there that the culprit was Jhon.
    He hopped in the coaster and flew off to Skaia
    so pooplice raised his gun and shot a papaya.
    It sailed through the air and smacked Jhon in the face
    but, alas, he was already distant in space.
    And he cried as he flew to the planets unknown,
    “its tiem to se if i can make roze moan”

    (Hey!)

    (We're Cool and New)
    (Hey!)
    (We're Cool and New)

    Now listen closely

    Here's a little lesson for web comics
    This is going down as the best gimmick
    If you wanna be like Toby Cool and New
    You have to catch Andrew Hussie on the cue

    Just follow my memes, and shit around.
    Be careful not to post those leaks.

    [I'm thinking of a number]
    No, don't post that!

    (We're Cool and New)
    (Hey!)
    (We're Cool and New)

    HAHAHAH

    Now look at this song, that I have made
    When I hit play, be ready to quake

    (AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)

    Uh, let's try something else

    Now watch and learn, here's the deal
    You slip and slide on this banana peel [author's notes, this verse is too good of a rhyme, i refuse to change this]

    (ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
