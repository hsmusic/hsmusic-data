    So for Disk 1 I decided to write a character select theme in the vain of Street Fighter 2. I thought it would be a perfect fit for the art [[artist:kiddlescribbles|Kiddles]] made (which is really good btw).

    Escapade is a song i wrote a long time ago under the name "LoSaS" (don't look it up) because i originally wrote it as a land theme for a land [[artist:kiddlescribbles|Kiddles]] made for some stupid dead pmt comic thing we were working on at the time. I later reused it on my shitty solo album for god knows what reason, and now it has made it's way into [[album:desynced-vol-1|Desynced]] and STLaP 3. This version of Escapade was supposed to be a song about a good guy version of Jack Noir which is why it sounds so much like [[track:black]], later though when I just joined the Desynced music team, Emily said they would need a song like Escapade for something later on in the comic so i just offered to let her use it and thats pretty much why its also in there now.<br>
    This is most definitely my favorite version of Escapade by far but i still dont like a lot of things about it so who knows...

    idk why, since it isn't exactly a super complex song, but this one kinda took a lot out of me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a lazy motherflipper and all, but oh boy was I unmotivated to work on this one more than usual. It probably doesn't help that I was going through some intense imposter syndrome as a musician at the time, and I was kinda getting out of the HS fandom as well. Still, I powered through, and honestly, I think it turned out fairly well, all things considered.

    Alright so I have quite a bit to say about this track. A last year [[group:the-paradox-music-team|the PMT]] put out [our earthbound album](https://pascalpotatovandenbos.bandcamp.com/album/whats-your-favorite-song-earthbound-2019), which was a fun little break from our usual homestuck music thing. I wrote a song on that album called [[track:diamond-dust|"Diamond Dust"]] that quickly became one of my favorite songs I had written at the time. Shortly after the album came out I had the desire make a proper follow up to that track. Sometime later, I was improving on the piano and got this really nice sounding chord progression that made me think of snow. I was looking for an idea at the time for STLaP 3 at the time, so I made this my last song for the album. During the process of writing this song, I had the idea of remixing "Diamond Dust" into this, effectively making Snowfall the a sequel to that song. Overall I'm pretty proud how this turned out and I'm glad I got to make the follow up I wanted.

    So i asked [[artist:tee-vee|Tee-Vee]] cover my remix of [[track:MeGaLoVania]] as a bonus song for this album because i originally wanted it to be played live for BefoprusBound but we ran out of time so i left my original guitars in there. He did an amazing job though, like i didn't think that solo at the end was playable to be honest but whaddaya know, it sounds fucking epic lmao. Now i just gotta get him to play the DX version...
