    "a blow connecting and it knocks me out; a hand extended so i don't stay down!"

    fighting is kinda gay if you think about it, like you're literally beating other women's asses 🤨

Lyrics: |-
    My love delivered by a fistfight
    'Cause nothing else has ever felt right
    A blow connecting and it knocks me out
    A hand extended so I don't stay down
    You love me like you've never met me
    And babe I'm sorry but it's boring
    'Cause every lover that I've had fell through
    But none of them could mop the floor like you do

    I don't want a love that rhymes
    My heart's been broken for the last damn time
    So maybe we can be opponents
    (And get excited for a moment)

    I keep a bullet with your name inside my zone
    So baby I don't wanna hear it
    'Til your hands get thrown
    You always say that you don't wanna let it go
    But baby I don't wanna hear it
    'Til some hands get thrown or you head back home

    So BEAT SOME ASS! And don't take it back, I'm
    BUILT TO LAST! And my fist flies fast, so
    Let's see who makes it to the end!

    My love delivered in a beatdown
    It's kinda lonely 'till you come 'round
    But in the moment that I see your face
    That fuzzy sentiment is all replaced
    You better hit me where it matters
    'Cause I'm not one for being flattered
    A simple silhouette of breakbeats bent
    Our people posturing and playing pretend

    I don't need a love that lasts
    And even if our fire burns too fast
    I'll keep your tooth as a memento
    (I'll paint a pattern on the window)

    I keep a bullet with your name inside my zone
    So baby I don't wanna hear it
    'Til your hands get thrown
    I'll hold the needle if there's stitches you need sewn
    So baby I don't wanna hear it
    'Til some hands get thrown or you head back home

    So BEAT SOME ASS! And don't take it back, I'm
    BUILT TO LAST! And my fist flies fast, so
    Let's see who makes it to the end!

    (But can you make it on your own
    Making foes out of your friends?
    Well you're a fighter set in stone
    And she's a lovely target to contend)
    So we can make it pretty far
    All bruised and bloodied broken bones
    I've got an endless repertoire
    For someone that I hold so close, let your hands get thrown

    And BEAT SOME ASS! And don't take it back, I'm
    BUILT TO LAST! And my fist flies fast, it's
    BACK TO BACK! I don't cut no slack, so
    FULL ATTACK! 'Til my stance gets cracked, and
    I'll keep it coming to the end!
