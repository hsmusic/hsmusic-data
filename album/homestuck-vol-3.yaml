    <i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100615225737/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/))

    The third official Homestuck album, which includes the music of early to mid [[flash-act:a3|Act 3]].

    <i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20091217082112/http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/?game=autosave&s=6&p=002906))

    <b>Annnnd volumes 2 and 3 are up.</b>

    [[album:homestuck-vol-2|That was fast.]]

    Huge, ridiculous megaprops to [[artist:cindy-dominguez|Cindy]] for coordinating all this album stuff for me. It just wasn't happening otherwise. You might think we were dogging this release for a long time, but it really did take this long to get it all together, rounding up final mixes from [the crew](https://web.archive.org/web/20100113031120/http://mspaintadventures.com/soundcredits.html), reformatting chores and stuff.

    And a reminder: when you buy these songs the artists get the monies, so you're saying THANKS DUDES with your dollars.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Malcolm Brown:</i>
    Harlequin was awesome, and was quite a popular source for remixing the theme (it still is) so this was my early attempt.
    The soundfont is actually a FF6 SNES font I found somewhere (At lot of people got it from the choir). The SNES soundfont choice was taken from a kind of natural evolution the music was taking from the earlier Vol 1 8-bi to 16-bit style music.
    Not much to say on this one except it was quite a stereotypical 'Epic' boss battle theme - Choirs, church organs, bells, guitar and fast drums.

    <i>Nick Smalley:</i>
    WELL
    It was 2008 and I was a silly little boy and thought ORGMaker was good-ass music program, so I decided to make a song in it. Half an hour later forged this booger of a song. Seriously. It took half an hour to make this. Then I saw that THE HUSS posted something about a Problem Sleuth opening? So I was like damn that's bananas I'll show him up! (wow look at this nerd thinking he can actually make music)
    I sent it to his email and like a day later he sent one back asking about the music team. FLATTERING, IT WAS. So I was like sure sign me up g homey dog slice foo
    And that's the story of how I got on the music team.
    Oh wait. You just wanted Ohgodwhat.
    (ps that's what it was called when i made it too)

    The remix of Nick's "Ohgodwhat" is a terrifying little affair - that I even made it mystifies me.

    <i>BurnedKirby:</i> ([SoundCloud, on another track...](https://soundcloud.com/burnedkirby/electric-dream))

    > BurnedKirby, I really like your stuff, especially Rediscover Fusion; it's one of my favorite songs on [[album:homestuck-vol-1-4|Homestuck Volumes 1-4]]. I'm surprised there aren't a ton of Homestuck fans that are following you just because you made one song for the soundtrack 2 1/2 years ago :P

    Ah, thanks! Part of it is probably my being not too active in writing music. Another may be that they haven't accepted any song since that one, for Homestuck, but it happens. Thanks for following as well, as it means a lot to me.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    My signature efforts from this album, of course, are "Chorale for Jaspers" and its corollary (or chorale-ary?) "Pony Chorale". They were the first two Homestuck tracks to feature vocals with me as the cat and Tavia as Maplehoof - for this I am proud.
    ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/mguybowman/status/1669411378359328771))
    Got a message asking if "Chorale for Jaspers" is based on "[Time Is Running Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URYhXY5R0rQ)" by Muse and now I cannot unhear it.
