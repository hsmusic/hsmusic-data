    <i>Malcolm Brown:</i>
    Harlequin was awesome, and was quite a popular source for remixing the theme (it still is) so this was my early attempt.
    The soundfont is actually a FF6 SNES font I found somewhere (At lot of people got it from the choir). The SNES soundfont choice was taken from a kind of natural evolution the music was taking from the earlier Vol 1 8-bi to 16-bit style music.
    Not much to say on this one except it was quite a stereotypical 'Epic' boss battle theme - Choirs, church organs, bells, guitar and fast drums.

    <i>Nick Smalley:</i>
    WELL
    It was 2008 and I was a silly little boy and thought ORGMaker was good-ass music program, so I decided to make a song in it. Half an hour later forged this booger of a song. Seriously. It took half an hour to make this. Then I saw that THE HUSS posted something about a Problem Sleuth opening? So I was like damn that’s bananas I’ll show him up! (wow look at this nerd thinking he can actually make music)
    I sent it to his email and like a day later he sent one back asking about the music team. FLATTERING, IT WAS. So I was like sure sign me up g homey dog slice foo
    And that’s the story of how I got on the music team.
    Oh wait. You just wanted Ohgodwhat.
    (ps that’s what it was called when i made it too)
