    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    Just over five months ago, the researchers over at OpenAI published an article on their new music-generating neural network called "Musenet" [1]. In the time since, we've been working with this program to create songs that are both cool and new.
    The first side of this album is those songs that we deemed good enough to give a proper studio treatment, and we've arranged, mixed, and perfected them accordingly. The second side is reserved for the songs that we kept in their original midi format, whether due to impossibility, laziness, or some other factor. Regardless, we hope listening to this album is as fun as making it was.

    Additionally, in this wiki page you'll find 30 midi files for some of the songs present on this album.

    Special thanks to [[artist:mrcheeze]] for his API trick.
