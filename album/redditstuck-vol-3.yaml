Commentary: |-
    <i>pragmaticNihilist:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    I made this song because of Evan’s conversation with Josh, which particularly struck me. It leaves a lot of room for potential character development; in fact, it gives me the impression that Evan will reach a breaking point, hence the more powerful end to this track. Evan tries so hard to please that he may just end up isolating himself.

    <i>HeyItsKane:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)

    I decided i was going to do something without lineart for once, and i’m honestly surprised that it wasn’t completely terrible.

    <i>Kal-la-kal-la:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    Jazz... jazz is good. I decided I wanted to make a jazz-funk style track for the Land of Casinos and Hedonism, and indeed, for a while the project file for this track was just called Jazz-Funk.als. I worked out the chords at the piano, and had a lot of fun working out the bass part, which is intended to drive the track.

    <i>David Burt:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)

    Do not let the title of this track deceive you, this is a land of Blackjack and hookers. The blackjack is rigged, and the hookers like to dance. They’re also green and feel like pool table felt.

    This land shot was definitely a challenge, as the panel went through several iterations before it wasn't too much of an eyesore. Originally there were many more neon signs and a massive slot machine in the distance, glowing through the fog. However the team agreed with me that there were too many things to look at. I didn't want to take too much attention away from lady liberty’s saucy sister.

    I just really wanted to make a song for Tomesprite, so I did. I think I finished it a couple of days after Tomesprite was revealed. It was also fun playing with synths, which I hope to do more of in the future.

    <i>HeyItsKane:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)

    My main focus was going into more detail with tomesprite’s face. Admittedly the sev i drew could probably have used a bit more work, but the thing’s already done.

    This was originally supposed to be in the Windwaker soundfont, but I gave up on that after five minutes. Instead, I used my trademark saxophone that I stole from [[artist:kal-la-kal-la|Kal]], as well as my trademark accordion/melodica/bandoneon. And also my trademark Kapp’n guitar, which also happens to sound really good as a bass. Additional shoutout to SGM drums for being good in literally everything. Man, I love soundfonts. Anyway, this song was a lot of fun to make, and hopefully fun to listen to as well.

    <i>Husr:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    As seconds pass into minutes and minutes into hours, the dreary tedium of amusing oneself can begin to wear one down. <i>Attendre</i> attempts to capture that boredom- inflicted deterioration.

    <i>Bin:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)

    Husr gave me free rein over track art, more or less, which was probably a bad idea on his part, considering the end result. It's a bit of a loose interpretation of "waiting for time to pass," but I think it still embodies the central themes of frustration and tedium. Anyway, sprites look bad when you rotate them, so I put a radial blur over the whole thing so people would thing it was intentional. You tend to pick up on these kinds of tricks when you're a master artist like I am.

    This song represents how Sev wants to be cool, calm, and collected, like some sort of main character in an anime. Except he’s not, have you SEEN the dude? So everything falls apart at the end.

    Big thanks to the other people on the Redditstuck album team, I couldn’t have made it sound good without them.

    <i>Bin:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    I started this one way back in April, so I’m glad that it finally gets to see the light of day. The process was very similar to [[Saoshyant]], mostly consisting of messing around with drum patterns and going ham with the strings. The Touhou Japanese influence started to leak in after a while, and I was powerless to stop it. For the majority of the song, the melody is driven by a koto, with support from a shamisen, though they switch places in the latter half. The shakuhachi makes a brief cameo in the middle, because the weebs have their hands in everything. Finally, I’m officially suing [[artist:gordian|Gordian]] for stealing this song. You’ll hear from my lawyers.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Kal-la-kal-la:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    I endeavoured to express a feeling of ‘stasis’ with this track. The title comes from the name of a song by Sufjan Stevens, [‘For the Widows In Paradise, For The Fatherless In Ypsilanti’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWb_sK18pgw). When first I heard the song I had no idea that Paradise and Ypsilanti are the names of towns in the US State of Michigan. As such I assumed Ypsilanti was some sort of term that referred to purgatory, corresponding to paradise. And that’s what this track is meant to represent, my idea of what ‘purgatory’ sounds like. Distant echoes in caverns of ice. What does that have to do with Redditstuck, you might ask? You’ll see.

    <i>Lazicful:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)

    After a lot of artistic consideration I ultimately decided to go with the 2 things that come to mind when I hear stasis and icy cave; stalagmites and bricks, for what is more static than a brick? I also thought to myself, ”what would be a fitting choice of color for such a cool, cold cavern?” Blue! Blue is a very cold color, it all added up! And so I decided to make the image purely consist of blues, to truly convey the isolated feeling of a desolate area with truckloads of “stasis”. The track utilises a lot of, bear with me here it’s going to get a little music theory-y, “echo and reverb”, noises that are supposed to simulate sound hitting distant walls. And since the echoing is so intense, it made sense for the area to be positively huge!

    for volume 3: does Ypsilanti show a known location/planet?

    <i>Austinado:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)

    I wanted to make something that wasn’t just in the MSPA style for this track. Sadly though I’ve been doing nothing but MSPA style due to working on Vast Error’s EOA1 for weeks before I was meant to do this so I feel the end product isn’t the best representation of what I can do. I really like the shading I gave DD here though.

    They are all kind of about religion and holiness<br>
    I guess if we are looking at it all from afar I should give up the game a little

    The [[Frieden]] art is the Cologne Cathedral<br>
    The [[track:gnade-redditstuck|Gnade]] art is the Lichtdom ("Cathedral of Lights")<br>
    And the names respectively mean Peace, Grace, and Calm

    I think all I have to add is the obvious connection to Evan and Eve

    Oh one more thing: "Ruhe und Frieden" means "peace and quiet" as in "Give me some peace and quiet!" But "Ruhe <strong>in</strong> Frieden" means "Rest in Peace"

    I was playing about at the piano when I found this chord progression, and I thought it was pretty pleasing. Ran to the computer, clicked in the chords and improvised over them on the accordion, then added the rest of the instrumentation and mixed it. I was aiming to give the whole piece a cosy, nostalgic feeling, like a fond memory of something past that one might calming. The e-piano with delay reminded me of the Volume 1 track [[Colt Blooded]] by jjpollution, which was written as a theme for Luke, and I figured Gallopsby to be something that would be associated with happy memories for Luke.

Lyrics: |-
    Sometimes I think about the stars
    And Mercury and Mars
    Knowin' I'll get to go someday
    But then they finally come around
    So high above the ground
    And the feeling goes away
    I used to wait for something more
    To walk in through the door
    Something I never thought I'd do
    I guess I figured that by now
    I'd have some kind of plan
    Really the opposite is true
    And it doesn't matter just how long
    That the dream is s'posed to be
    Cause I wanna wake up anyway
    If they knew what I could do
    The things that I've been through
    They wouldn't make me have to stay
    Running away from all my fears
    And stopping all the tears
    Things I was never meant to do
    I hope you'll understand someday
    I can't afford to stay
    Clearly my waiting days are through
    And it doesn't matter just how long
    That the dream is s'posed to be
    Cause I wanna wake up anyway
    If they knew what I could do
    The things that I've been through
    They wouldn't make me have to stay

    Look out the window at the stars
    And through the iron bars
    Looks like the sky is turning blue
    I know what people always say
    No one's made it all the way
    I'm starting to think it might be true
    And it doesn't matter just how long
    That the dream is s'posed to be
    Cause I wanna wake up anyway
    If they knew what I could do
    And the shit that I've been through
    They wouldn't make me have to stay
    And it doesn't matter just how long
    That the dream was s'posed to be
    Cause I had to wake up anyway

    <i>Gordian:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    song written by me. we considered a version without words but that would defeat the point. i guess we all agreed on how intrinsic they were.

    this was actually a song about Chelsea to begin with - or at least, my interpretation of her character, and not a canon representation. In a way, it’s about how relatable chelsea is, to me. this is me basically saying “it’s not lore you dunkass”.

    <i>ConstaChymic:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)

    I was gonna make the image just like I do other drawings, but then I remembered that most of the artstyle for HS related stuff is no AA lines, so I made it pixel lines. This kinda made it not turn out the way I wanted, because I’m terribad with pixelated lines, but I dont really think I wanna change it.

    <i>Bin:</i> (assistant artist, booklet commentary)

    I've never played Persona, but I thought the "desaturated person on saturated background" thing was cool, so I did it to Consta's art. I also added the weird black and white shadow things for a wacky 3D effect. Basically, Consta did all the hard work and I messed around in Photoshop for like 20 minutes. Please direct all praise to Consta.

    <i>Redditstuck:</i> ([Bandcamp description](https://redditstuckmusic.bandcamp.com/track/unreal-city))

    Who is the third who walks always beside you?<br>
    When I count, there are only you and I together<br>
    But when I look ahead up the white road<br>
    There is always another one walking beside you<br>
    Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded<br>
    I do not know whether a man or a woman<br>
    —But who is that on the other side of you?

    <i>Kal-la-kal-la:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    <i>Unreal city,<br>
    Over the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br>
    A crowd flowed over London Bridge so many,<br>
    I had not thought death had undone so many.</i>

    With this track I attempted to embody the eerie feeling I associate with Derse. The track is in 7/4 because that’s the best time sig, with various industrial drum loops that were originally in 4/4 cut together to create the beat. There are various elements that aren’t in sync with the rhythm of the track and are more textural than anything else, intended to represent the sound of things heard far away. The piano track is particularly inspired by the piano from the song [‘Condition Oakland’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWRdSSZNGCE) by Jawbreaker.

    <i>HeyItsKane:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)

    I decided I wanted to try and do a detailed image of derse, because the song is about derse and i’m apparently a masochist.
