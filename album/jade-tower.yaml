    Kanaya Maryam runs a humble and small restaurant just outside of town with her wife called Rosemary’s. One day, a floating puppet head shows up and threatens to vaporize the restaurant. Kanaya, immediately feeling violated due to the threat on her and her wife's livelihood, runs off to the tower from which the puppet head came from, with her lovely wife Rose Lalonde and their adopted consort child Casey in tow.
