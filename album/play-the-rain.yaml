    <i>Lunise:</i> ([Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/tiny-mayo/34010165892/this-track-art-caused-me-so-much-pain-and), artwork for [[album:lofam2]])

    <img src="media/misc/stalemate-lofam2.jpg" width="350">

    THIS TRACK ART CAUSED ME SO MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING so I'm just calling it done because I like how it looks now. I drew this for Stalemate, which should be on the [[album:lofam2|LOFAM2]] album that will hopefully come out by Christmas this year!

    This track art is making me cry over how a lot of my favorite characters are Dersites and how hard they are to color well in a painterly style, just so you know. The crack in the Furthest Ring was a whole lot of fun, though! I can't exactly make this animated since it's track art, so I decided to make a lot of little hue changes in the crack itself. I'm pretty satisfied with the effect I got by doing that!

    <small>#lune draws things once every blue moon #lune is still kind of sort of terrible-ish at commentary</small>

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    Although Stalemate didn't end up on [[album:lofam2]] in the end ([[track:sburban-genesis-lofam2]] by the same artist did, instead), this artwork ended up getting used about a year later for [[track:dogfight-dirtiests-dubstep-remix]] on [[album:lofam3]]!
