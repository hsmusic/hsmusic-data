    <i>artist:kobacat:</i> (Bandcamp about blurb)

    This album is a compilation of music I released as apart of the [[group:canmt|'Cool and New Music Team' or 'CaNMT' collective music team]] over the course of 5 years, from 2016 to 2021.

    Many of these tracks I may not hold in high regard of today, as a lot of these tracks don't have much effort put into them as I would have liked them to if I made them today, but this stands as an archive of the most notable work I've done over those 5 years.

    There's a total of 5 songs from 2016, 7 songs from 2017, 10 songs from 2018, 7 songs from 2019, 2 songs from 2020 and 1 song from 2021. Every track has details such as references, links to the original upload from either YouTube or Bandcamp, credits for songs if it was made by more than just me and track art (if the song has it), and original release dates.

    I hope this serves are a neat time capsule of things that I've done over a while, even if it's not much. If you're checking this album out as the first thing you've heard me make, please note that I don't make music nearly this often anymore and like this at all (with the exception of 2021's track which was the most recent song I made as of writing lol)

Lyrics: |-
    Oh Diet Dr Pepper is the flavor that I savor
    It's sweet and spicy, totally unique
    It makes me want to sing this song about my soft drink saviour
    That brings me joy when everything looks bleak

    Oh Diet Dr Pepper by the can or by the twenty
    I drink them morning, afternoon, and night
    It's got no fat or calories but taste it has aplenty
    Beats cola, root beer, juice, and even Sprite

    There can just be only one true Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Loyal subjects, me and you, to Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Death to every other drink but Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Because they just really stink but Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper

    I'll show you to a brand new world of Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Our banner flies proudly unfurled for Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Lay waste to all the other drinks it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Satisfying all my kinks it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper

    Oh Diet Dr Pepper raise the flag of revolution
    And murder every soft drink in your way
    Your perfect taste has led me to a new Final Solution
    Kill everyone, start with a brand new day

    And as the dawn rises anew on Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    The drink of choice for me and you, it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Taste like this just can't be beat, oh Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Pepsi lies dead in the street, it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper

    There can just be only one true Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Loyal subjects, me and you, to Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Death to every other drink but Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Because they just really stink but Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper

    I'll show you to a brand new world of Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Our banner flies proudly unfurled for Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Lay waste to all the other drinks it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Satisfying all my kinks it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper

    Oh Diet Dr Pepper is the flavor that I savor
    It's sweet and spicy, totally unique
    It makes me want to sing this song about my soft drink saviour
    That brings me joy when everything looks bleak

    Oh Diet Dr Pepper by the can or by the twenty
    I drink them morning, afternoon, and night
    It's got no fat or calories but taste it has aplenty

    Magic for me
    Magic makes no sound
    It good for me
    It good for me underground
    Magic on me
    Really got me down
    Invade my city
    It made my heart beat no sound

    Beat no sound, beat no sound
    Beat no sound, beat no sound
    Beat no sound, beat no sound
    Beat no sound, beat no sound

    And let me tell myself
    Tell on

    She turned my dad on
    She turned my dad on, dad on, dad on
    She turned my dad on, dad on, dad on

    Magic for me
    Magic, get me through
    With magic money
    People seem to walk through you
    Magic's funny
    Magic, get me through
    All good for me
    When people seem to always walk through you

    Walk through you, walk through you
    Walk through you, walk through you
    Walk through you, walk through you
    Walk through you, walk through you
    Walk through you, walk through you
    Walk through you, walk through you
    Walk through you, walk through you
    Walk through you, walk through you

    And let me tell myself

    Walk through you, walk through you
    Walk through you, walk through you (She turned my dad on, dad on, dad on)
    Walk through you, walk through you
