    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    Track name is as released [on Tindeck](https://web.archive.org/web/20180503070606/http://tindeck.com/users/Plasma).

    There are three prominent early versions of Cascade. This track, "Cascade Cut", is possibly the first one produced, and is exactly the version featured in [[flash:4109]]; it fades out at the end, transitioning into [[Savior of the Dreaming Dead (Cascade Cut)]].

    The second version is [[Flare]], the third track on [[album:homestuck-vol-8]], and it has an alternate ending without the dramatic confrontation between Snowman and Spades Slick, settling more calmly.

    Finally, [[Flare (Cascade)]], a remaster - also by Clark Powell - which sought to turn the original into a full track of its own right. (This one got around sixteen thousand notes on Tumblr!)

    Unofficial name. You see, originally [[track:flare-cascade]] was released as [[track:flare-cascade-cut]], so the same was appended by fans to the edited form of [[track:savior-of-the-dreaming-dead]] seen in [[track:cascade]]. Later on when 'Flare (Cascade Cut)' was revamped and released under simply 'Flare (Cascade)' the name for this one had already stuck, and remained that way since.

    My goal with this track was to create an alternate version of [[Darling Kanaya]], except more reverent and mature.

    The first few notes the track are similar to the first few notes of Kanaya’s theme, but the songs quickly differentiate from there. Two people that are initially the same… I like that concept.

    Aw yeah! What's up gamers?
    I'm GameGrl, and I'm here to show you that girls can game too!
    Don't go easy on me, guys - unless you want to get beat by a GIRL
    Are you ready? Let's DO THIS!

    Yo I'm the GameGrl, and I've got the scores
    'Cause I woop butt and game hardcore
    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin

    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!

    When I say "game", you say "girl!"
    GAME! GRL! GAME! GRL!
    When I say "best", you say "the world!"
    BEST IN! THE WORLD! BEST IN! THE WORLD!
    When I say girls, you say rule!
    GIRLS! RULE! GIRLS! RULE!
    When I say boys, you say drool!
    BOYS! DROOL! BO-BO-BO-BO—

    (Objection!) GAME ATTACK! (Objection!) GAME ATTACK!
    When I'm on the scoreboard, you sure can tell!
    (Objection!) GAME ATTACK! (Objection!) GAME ATTACK!
    Cause I spell my scores "G-R-L!"
    (Objection!) GAME ATTACK! (Objection!) GAME ATTACK!
    You gamer guys better take it like a man!
    (Objection!) GAME ATTACK! (Objection!) GAME ATTACK!
    If you can't keep up then talk to the hand!

    (She's a GameGrl) I'm the GameGrl!
    (She's a GameGrl) The best in the world!
    (She's a GameGrl) Girls rule!
    (She's a GameGrl) And boys drool!
    (She's a GameGrl) I'm kickin' rad!
    (She's a GameGrl) You're super bad!

    When you're gaming with the GameGrl you're gaming with the best!

    <i>Toby Fox:</i> ([Tumblr](https://fwugradiation.tumblr.com/post/32195893135/crab-waltz-my-new-track-from-the-latest-update), excerpt)

    [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]] asked if it was possible to make a more downbeat version of [[track:karkats-theme|Karkat’s Theme]]. I started from scratch, creating a version without the goofy sound effects but keeping the eclectic orchestral-chiptune palette.

    It starts a little slow, but I think it fits the mood. Unlike the original track, this isn’t a song about an irate leader on the warpath - it’s about a messed up kid working his way through his own disillusionment.

    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Well come on, get ready, get set, and here we go

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    You've gotta be ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing
    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never never foe
    So let's f-cking go!

    Uh, uh, do it, do it!
    Uh, uh, uh, do it, do it!
    Uh, uh, do it, do it!
    Uh, uh, uh, alright!

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop-tic Blast
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will stop

Commentary: |-
    <i>Toby Fox:</i>
    108 Stars of Density, my new track from the latest [[flash:5398|update]].

    This song was actually a scrapped attempt at another Meenah song for Volume 9, created out of frustration towards composing [[track:hate-you]]. The song is based off of the ending portion of Hate You, starting at 2:11, which in turn was based off of the intro from [[track:love-you-feferis-theme|Love You]]. I took it out of hibernation and finished it for the update.

    The weird name is a reference to Suikoden, a PlayStation RPG where you walk around talking to characters trying to recruit them into your army. Each character you can recruit corresponds to one of the 108 Stars of Destiny.

    As Meenah, you walk around trying to recruit constellation-corresponding characters into your army………….

    <i>James Roach:</i>
    oh yeah, the music you hear during Karkat's pesterquest route that isn't his theme is the rhythmic motif for the drones. it happens in a few other places in Act 1 and Friendsim, as well as multiple place in Act 2

    it might be a little wild because the motif isn't melodic, but a good example of it is in "[[track:keep-your-head-down]]" and during the drone cutscene in act 1
