Commentary: |-
    <i>Clark Powell:</i>
    I have recut and remastered my track Flare, as it was presented to you in the Cascade flash (rather than the calmed-down album version). I get asked a lot for this, so I decided to give it some extra love and attention.
    I have attempted a number of times to put together a mix of Flare that utilized the distinctive crescendo that is recognizable from Cascade, but it never seems to work well without the cinematic context. The buildup sort of leads to nothing, and then the track either ends awkwardly or fades out, and I have something personal against fade-outs. Maybe I’ll talk about that someday. But not now.
    I gave it another go, this time trying a decrescendo to bring the song back down from all the energy it riles up, then ending it on kind of a creepy note. I had more success here than I ever have in past attempts to cut the song together in this way.
    Flare was a pretty big hit in its own right, so there’s always the pressure coming from the responsibility to handle this properly. I hope you enjoy it!

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    Unofficial name. You see, originally [[track:flare-cascade]] was released as 'Flare (Cascade Cut)', so the same was appended by fans to the edited form of [[track:savior-of-the-dreaming-dead]] seen in [[track:cascade]]. Later on when 'Flare (Cascade Cut)' was revamped and release under simply 'Flare (Cascade)' the name for this one had already stuck, and remained that way since.

    Aw yeah! What's up gamers?
    I'm GameGrl, and I'm here to show you that girls can game too!
    Don't go easy on me, guys - unless you want to get beat by a GIRL
    Are you ready? Let's DO THIS!

    Yo I'm the GameGrl, and I've got the scores
    'Cause I woop butt and game hardcore
    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin

    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!

    When I say "game", you say "girl!"
    GAME! GRL! GAME! GRL!
    When I say "best", you say "the world!"
    BEST IN! THE WORLD! BEST IN! THE WORLD!
    When I say girls, you say rule!
    GIRLS! RULE! GIRLS! RULE!
    When I say boys, you say drool!
    BOYS! DROOL! BO-BO-BO-BO—

    (Objection!) GAME ATTACK! (Objection!) GAME ATTACK!
    When I'm on the scoreboard, you sure can tell!
    (Objection!) GAME ATTACK! (Objection!) GAME ATTACK!
    Cause I spell my scores "G-R-L!"
    (Objection!) GAME ATTACK! (Objection!) GAME ATTACK!
    You gamer guys better take it like a man!
    (Objection!) GAME ATTACK! (Objection!) GAME ATTACK!
    If you can't keep up then talk to the hand!

    (She's a GameGrl) I'm the GameGrl!
    (She's a GameGrl) The best in the world!
    (She's a GameGrl) Girls rule!

    When you're gaming with the GameGrl you're gaming with the best!

Lyrics: |-
    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Well come on, get ready, get set, and here we go

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    You've gotta be ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing
    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never never foe
    So let's f-cking go!

    Uh, uh, do it, do it!
    Uh, uh, uh, do it, do it!
    Uh, uh, do it, do it!
    Uh, uh, uh, alright!

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop-tic Blast
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will stop
    Uh!

Commentary: |-
    <i>James Roach:</i>
    this track presented a unique problem in that i didn't want to write it at the time. I had written a really somber and melancholic track for the area outside the hive (the farm in the concept art) and changing it into something a little goofier and weird presented a unique difficulty for me. I just didn't know what to do for the first time in like actual YEARS i had no idea where to even start. I kept at it for a very long time and eventually just muscled through it with sheer force of will. People often ask me the hardest track or my least favorite to work on. it was this one. silver lining: its also become one of my favorites. i love how it came out. thats the power of determination. did you know you can't say determination anymore.
    this was written for, yes, the fabled beekeeper troll that nobody will talk about. its become some sort of myth as to what happened to her but the truth isn't that exciting. in early hiveswap days each member of the crew got to "pick" a character that they could choose one design element of. The person who picked beekeeper just had a fantroll based off of herself. they also just... drew micro/macro porn of themselves? a power move, honestly. I met them in person and they offered me weed within literal minutes of meeting so i mean i guess they seemed nice. when they no longer worked for the company it was just simpler to redesign the character than deal with literally any of that. mystewy sowved :)
    at the point in production where they were figuring out names/personalities/traits they kinda thrust this one on me because it "would make the most people angry." beekeeper troll was beloved by a very specific kind of horny dude. you know the kind that regularly says "lewds" or w/e. nothin wrong with that i guess. chase your bliss. but in an effort by my SO CALLED FRIENDS to antagonize me, they were like "heh h h e h he e e he h what if we make this cute girl character that hornyboys love into a dumpy little round dude and then say we based him off james who they already do not like."
    thanks guys.
    anyway zebede's bullet points and even his name are references to me but thats kinda where it ends. st. james son of zebedee is also known as santiago, which is my birthname. the tongva were "maybe" the indigenous people of long beach, where i live, which is "too far to visit" which is a joke about The Greater Los Angeles Area. I live 20 minutes away. cowards.

    SO! PesterQuest is out. We've been sitting on this one for a while. This first route has been done for a while. It was supposed to come out back on 6/12 but our new publisher had us sit on it for reasons that are beyond even me. Anyway, big ups to Malcolm and Mark for letting me use their themes.
    I don't know if I'll have as much time or energy to do the tracks for pesterquest like i did for friendsim since i got a new job. I will try my best.

Commentary: |-
    <i>James Roach:</i>
    I wasn't certain how to approach this one. I knew if I was going to use the theme from endless climb it wouldn't feel right accepting any money for it. These things don't exactly pay well to begin with tbh, so i thought I would use the platform i've been given to try and do something... even a little positive.
    at first the song was just going to be called "play the rain" because naming it something stupid, while keeping up with tradition, seemed like it would be in bad taste. at some point while i was working on it i started looking into various charities i could donate the proceeds to, and it hit me that i could just ask to make the title in the credits a link to the charity.
    suicide is something that is hard for me to talk about. its very personal. i tend to internalize feelings in order not to.. bother anyone. a few months ago i called a suicide hotline when i hit a really low point and i think just the act of calling made me feel... in charge somehow? feelings are fucked up. don't be afraid to talk to someone. even if it is a stranger at the other end of a call. take that step. you're not bad for feeling that way.
    so anyway. endless climb was one of the very first homestuck songs that really drew me in, and doing a cover of it all those years ago really got me back into taking composition seriously. it could easily be argued that this song changed my life for the better.

    jades theme! wow we've really come a long way huh fellas?
    i always really liked carefree victory and its really one of the only songs that felt like uniquely hers. towards the end i try and do something that like... every homestuck musician i think tries at least once: getting all 4 of the kid's instruments to play something nice together. i think i did alright, i subbed in beatboxing for daves turntables cause its not like you can just carry those anywhere. i guess as opposed to johns piano?? LMAO
    musically i have jade start on bass, and as more of her friends come in she gets a little more confident in her basslines. anyway thats my fanfic.
    this is the last new piece i'll be doing for the forseeable future, or until i feel like doing another one which might be immediately. ive been doing this on a largely volunteer basis for a while since the budget constraints were tight and we need to pay the bg and sprite artists a reasonable amount. I wanted all four kids to have music by me and i think we'll be digging into the homestuck archive for other stuff.
    anyway i hope you've enjoyed the ride! its been a little bittersweet at times for me but i'll miss posting new stuff every two weeks.

    oh yeah, the music you hear during Karkat’s pesterquest route that isn’t his theme is the rhythmic motif for the drones. it happens in a few other places in Act 1 and Friendsim, as well as multiple place in Act 2

    it might be a little wild because the motif isn’t melodic, but a good example of it is in “[[track:keep-your-head-down]]” and during the drone cutscene in act 1

    (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/jamesroachmusic/pesterquest-this-time-its-eridan-i-forgot-what-i-named-this">SoundCloud</a>)
    in its base form this song used to be about a cat and is like more than a decade old
    (<a href="https://mkteres.tumblr.com/post/182160729885/jamesroachmusic-originally-there-was-a-troll-in">Tumblr</a>)
    Originally there was a troll in act 2 code named "Busker" that was the alternian version of those like.. one man bands you see when you go to venice beach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfINfEhxnLA">or like on the subway or w/e</a>. Just him and his weird accordion that also somehow made all these extra sounds.
    Anyway if you went up to him and did the right dialogue he would play you his song, which was this. I think he got written out because he was kind of a <i>one note character</i> ',:^]
