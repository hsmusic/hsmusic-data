Lyrics: |-
    To fall in love
    When broken down
    Will fill my mind with thoughts of doubt
    Because they’re not fine
    I see right through
    The goal that I saw
    Was not the truth

Lyrics: |-
    Three, two, two, ugh

    Listen up y'all, the apathy ain't post-ironic
    Turkin's TV beats handmade by plundering phonics

    'Arcalicious: definition, making Taz go loco'
    She wonders where the old me went, can't see him in my photos
    Always leaving or just staying
    Couldn't care less what she's saying
    Want one reason why I keep her?
    The resonance is a feature

    I'm Arcalicious
    Soulmates stuck on the waitlist
    And if you scour probabilities?
    That shit is fictitious
    My tongue strikes wicked (Blaugh)
    Can't say I find this very fun
    But there's a line down to the stronghold for a chance to be the one
    Real insipid (Cigarette sweet)
    Real insipid (Corporate cornsyrup prodigy)
    Real insipid (Even Kerian can't keep his mind off me)
    I'm Arcalicious (C-Code Red gets 'em thirsty, thirsty)

    Arcalicious def-
    Karkalicious def-
    Goddammit-
    Um, White Noise? Keep The Hyperthetical on track-

    'Arcalicious: definition, makes Filler go crazy'
    I just took Laivan's breath away, birthday boy, he's panting
    I'm A to the R, C, J, the E, the C
    And every lousy post you make online better untag me

    I'm Arcalicious (Real insipid)
    My body stays vicious
    Mirthamaniacs nervous at my "possum"-style fitness
    Coliad's my witness (What)
    I'll open up his third eye
    And he'll need samples of my blood 'cause I want to fucking die
    Real insipid (Cigarette sweet)
    Real insipid (Corporate cornsyrup prodigy)
    Real insipid (Even Secily couldn't keep away from me)
    I'm Arcalicious (Now all you wiseass fools hold up, check it out)

    Grubby, grubby, grubby
    If you really want me
    Honey get some soul
    Maybe then you'll find your place
    I'll be lazy, lazy
    Don't replace me, -place me
    Just don't leave me, leave me
    These lyrics drive me crazy
    T to the a, to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee", t to the a to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee"
    D to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s, to the d, to the e, to the, to the–

    Let me lay it down
    All the time I turn around the gang gathers 'round, always asking why a younger me is stuck inside my head
    I don't wanna say it now, I really ain't tryin' to weasel out of this but truth is neither of us even know
    And I guess I just don't know how to tell you all about it, even though I keep repeating that I should be left alone
    But what I'm trying to say, is something I don't know how to say…

    'Taz just screamed that:'
    I'm insipid (So insipid)
    Soulmates stuck on the waitlist
    And if you scour probabilities?
    That shit is fictitious
    My tongue strikes wicked (Blaugh)
    Can't say I find this very fun
    But there's a line down the stronghold for a chance to be the one
    My body stays vicious
    Coliad's been getting nervous knowing this is just business
    Serpaz's my witness
    Bet she knows how to make this fun
    Just watch her be first in line for a chance to be the one

    So insipid (Calder you see)
    So insipid (You're not like me)
    So insipid (I'll help you be)
    I'm Arcalicious (C-Code Red gets 'em thirsty, thirsty)
    I'm insipid (ay, ay, ay, ay) [No, no really, I'm not that great]
    I'm insipid (ay, ay, ay, ay) [Seriously, why the fuck is this still going on?!]
    So insipid (ay, ay, ay, ay) [Who WANTED this?! Oh god, I can feel it coming again!]
    I'm Arcalicious (she says I make her thirsty, thirsty)

    T to the a, to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee", t to the a to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee"
    D to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s, to the d, to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s
    T to the a, to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee". T to the a, to the, to the, to the
    To the d to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s
    To the d, to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s
    To the d, to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s
    To the d, to the e, to the– SWEET ALL-MOTHER MAKE IT FUCKING STOP!

    I don't know who's idea of a cruel, sick joke it was to make me do this parody of a parody like my life depended on it. But congrats! You got your ugly, insufferable wish!!
    I sure as fuck didn't agree to it! But it's all yours, now and forever so long as there is someone so outlandishly cringeworthy stumbling their bad taste to the end of this travesty.
    Whoever you are, this is the rotten fruit of your labor, and I hope you're happy!
    Oh– oh GOD– it's happening again!
