    Created as an homage to the final battle of the Super Nintendo game <i>EarthBound</i> utilizing instruments from the game itself. A rockin' midi boss battle theme for an alien overlord.

    From the collaborative EarthBound fan-album I was a part of a while back.

    Clearly callback to the <a href="https://youtu.be/tMCXMg8p9sc">final boss theme in the original game</a>, in both instrumentation and structure. I’m not as good at writing dissonant, alien metal, so I took a more melodic approach, integrating the low-intensity NES section into the rest of the song instead of dropping it once the guitars kick in. The melodic section is a little bit inspired by [[artist:malcolm-brown|Malcolm Brown]]’s [[track:rex-duodecim-angelus|Rex Duodecim Angelus]].

    I snuck in some warping, pitch-bended bass notes like the original did. See if you can hear them at 1:09-1:15. Another little musical detail that I’m proud of is that I managed to re-use the sample from the guitar solo that plays on the opening Gas Station screen of the game.

    The name is clearly a shout-out to Mother 2’s original subtitle: “Gyiyg Strikes Back!” It’s also a reference to [[track:megalovania-halloween|Megalovania]], the other boss song I made using EarthBound instrumentation for a ROM Hack I created during my junior year of High School.

    There are a lot of chill songs in EarthBound with rolly-snare drum loops, chill chords, and poppy, droopy bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/8SH2tEgUo2s">Hospital</a> definitely comes to mind, as does the [[track:choose-a-file|Select Your File]] theme. This song is essentially a fusion of those two tracks to create something chill and faux-nostalgic. It’s always nice to make something that isn’t punching you in the face.
