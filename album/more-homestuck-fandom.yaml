Lyrics: |-
    A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO...
    far in the depths of paradox space
    a new lifeform is about to be created
    one whose origin is as enigmatic as the glimmer of a musclebeast's teat
    some are carried in by storks
    some are recreated from paradox slime
    others appear wet out of their best friend's magical nonexistent vagina
    but regardless of how these beings may be formed
    they all come into the world with a special force:
    one called
    LOVE
    this is the story of one man's search for love and truth
    in a universe forgotten by time
    the story of those fearful creatures
    those that we call
    <big><big><i>BABIES</i></big></big>

    Unofficial name. If I recall correctly, I gave it that name for the Homestuck Sound Test because when [[group:toby-fox]] shared the track on his Tumblr, he shared it alongside a picture of Aradia (and nothing else to identify the song with), almost certainly the [[media:misc/aradias-theme-pre-death.png|same picture I used as track art for the song]] in the first versions of the Sound Test.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i>
    Whew... this is a really, REALLY old one of mine. I wrote the first version of "Bane" in 2001, and this version (the 'latest' one) was written in 2005. It's been a long time since I did anything with this theme, but I still really like it. I've been thinking about making a [[track:bane-p-s|newer version]] of it (since surely I've gotten better over the past decade, right?).

    I kind of regret not slipping this theme into Homestuck somewhere; I feel like this could have easily been a recurring signature theme for projects I work on (like [[group:toby-fox|Toby Fox]] does with '[[track:megalovania-ebhh|Megalovania]]').

    <i>James Roach:</i> ([Tumblr](https://jamesroach.tumblr.com/post/172233581852/originally-there-was-a-troll-in-act-2-code))

    Originally there was a troll in act 2 code named “Busker” that was the alternian version of those like.. one man bands you see when you go to venice beach [or like on the subway or w/e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfINfEhxnLA). Just him and his weird accordion that also somehow made all these extra sounds.

    Anyway if you went up to him and did the right dialogue he would play you his song, which was this. I think he got written out because he was kind of a one note character ‘,:^]

   Another music doodle today. Is there a word for those? A Moodle? Muudle? Y'know what sod it it's a Musicoodle.

   Figured I hadn't done any Halloweeny music on 'ere so whipped up another quick. 45 minutes! Although this one's cheating because it's full of [[track:crustacean|borrowed]] [[track:rex-duodecim-angelus|Homestuck]] stuff. It was goin' to be some kind of Underwater Level music originally but then I remembered "Oh yeah, Halloween" so here we are.

   Also hey! That [[track:sound-judgement|Terezi track WIP]] I posted up a while back has had quite a bit of interest. Should have some good news for your guys come the inevitable [[album:homestuck-vol-10|VOLUME 10]] since I've been workin' on it since then, although at this point it's kind've in "Alternate Universe"-ville given the current state of affairs and whatnot.

   Right it's the weekend. Expect another Musicoodle over the weekend of some form. Might even hook up a keyboard and actually compose stuff live which is something I almost never do and really should.

   Good weekend ya'll!

   Also unofficially called "Cheer up, crabface, it's Halloween!", which appears to originate from [this YouTube upload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nQIPA5KcNI) by Cri. Based on [this comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nQIPA5KcNI&lc=UgyjeNL5FuLWeRBJt0p4AaABAg.8ZPBmlPLzXh8ZPO2ANyfw6)...

   > I **WAS** going to add the source but I forgot, sorry. I got the entire Homestuck soundtrack from a download link I found from a thread on the wiki, and I don't know how to find it again due to not knowing exactly what I had searched for to find it. My fault all the way, sorry.

   ...it seems Cri obtained this track from the sound test, or a similar source, rather than directly from the composer's Tumblr. This version of the name certainly *doesn't* originate from the sound test, where the track is instead called "Cheer up, Crabface, it's Halloween".

    DEBUNK

    <hr>

    The last of my three entries to the Homestuck Music Contest, the other two being [[Guns Blazing]] and [[Vodka Mutiny]].

    A song for Kanaya, this song is - in my opinion - the weakest contender of the lot. Daywalker nonetheless marks my first attempt at using real audio in a song - I recorded the flute performance myself. Unfortunately, my playing, recording, and production are definitely not up to snuff, honestly. Given that it was recorded with a terrible laptop mic, with a player who hadn't played in a long while (me), I suppose that was honestly no surprise.

    However, I love both the harp and flute melodies in this song. It was a blast to play, and I'd definitely think about using them again at some point in the future.

    <i>Clark Powell:</i> ([Tumblr](https://plazmataz.tumblr.com/post/19774190658/download-flare-cascade-i-have-recut-and))

    I have recut and remastered my track Flare, as it was presented to you in the Cascade flash (rather than the calmed-down [[Flare|album version]]). I get asked a lot for this, so I decided to give it some extra love and attention.

    I have attempted a number of times to put together a mix of Flare that utilized the distinctive crescendo that is recognizable [[track:flare-cascade-cut|from Cascade]], but it never seems to work well without the cinematic context. The buildup sort of leads to nothing, and then the track either ends awkwardly or fades out, and I have something personal against fade-outs. Maybe I'll talk about that someday. But not now.

    I gave it another go, this time trying a decrescendo to bring the song back down from all the energy it riles up, then ending it on kind of a creepy note. I had more success here than I ever have in past attempts to cut the song together in this way.

    Flare was a pretty big hit in its own right, so there's always the pressure coming from the responsibility to handle this properly. I hope you enjoy it!

   <b>Canned Corner: Flight of the White Wolf</b>

   Ahh, Flight of the White Wolf. This guy was in development for ages and basically supposed to be a kind of background track for PM vs Jack in their crazy god/wolf forms.

   The reason it never got anywhere is for a few reasons: a) I never quite got the bit that begins at 0:42 right (That whole section went through dozens of iterations, some with live guitar, some without the [[track:rex-duodecim-angelus|RDA]] reference etc.) and b) [[track:a-taste-for-adventure|A Taste Of Adventure]] was <b>infinitely</b> better as both an orchestral piece and a remix of [[track:dissension-original|Dissension]], so I binned it.

   The only bit of this track I still really like (and may save for a future project ;) ) is 0:00 to 0:42 (Which returns right at the end). The rest of it I reckon's a bit meh (Although some of the percussion I like).

   Also since there's no reference to [[track:black]] or anything Jack-esque then it's even less suitable for the original goal. It's still a "reasonably" ok track, but alas didn't make the cut.

   Hope you guys enjoy it!

    <i>Clark Powell:</i> ([Tumblr](https://plazmataz.tumblr.com/post/23084666959/and-for-your-listening-pleasure-a-snippet-of))

    And for your listening pleasure, a snippet of something called Jane Dargason. It is an unfinished track, part of my work lately putting together some music for [[album:homestuck-vol-9|Homestuck Volume 9]]. The beautiful artwork, for which the music is arguably just a vehicle, is brought to you by the astounding talent of [[artist:tavia-morra|Tavia Morra]].

    You remember [[Jade Dragon]], right? The rich wall of sound therein owes itself to the fact that it samples [[Viva la Vida]], from its namesake Coldplay album. Jane Dargason is a spiritual successor, using samplework from [[Life in Technicolor]] off the same album. All of this is combined here to surprisingly lovely effect with sounds from an unreleased track by RJ (who, as we have discussed, is the coolest).

    In short, we have an anthemic Jane tune in the workings!

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    This upload to Tumblr featured artwork by Tavia Morra which would eventually end up used on [[album:homestuck-vol-9]] for [[track:princess-of-helium]], rather than [[track:jane-dargason|the final version of this track]] (which featured art by [[artist:dawn-davis]] instead).

    trust.

    because i know you're dying of curiosity

    here is the original mp3 i sent [[artist:clark-powell|clark]] that began this exciting journey. note that it is literally nothing like the final mix, or even [[track:jane-dargason-may-11|the mix posted three weeks ago]]. it is a completely different thing.

Lyrics: |-
    Lonely submarine in murky shades of blue and green
    A silent knock on Davy Jones' door
    Octopi and hydronauts explore unsalvaged shipwrecks caught
    In coral reefs that span the ocean floor

    The geothermal chemistry
    Of vents below the deep blue sea
    Burning on and on
    The winking of an angler's light
    You make this underwater flight
    Down where there is no sun

    My love lies with the sea
    My love lies with the ocean
    My love lies with the sea
    My love lies with the ocean

    My, the continental shelf and all its sunken wealth
    Bones of those who walked the plank
    The depth to which these pirates sank
    Crushed by pressures great
    The submarine has lost its way
    Shall we ever make it to the bay
    From where we once did leave?
    A sonar ping still rings for help
    Diffused amongst a cloud of kelp
    Where mermaid kingdoms breathe

    My love lies with the sea
    My love lies with the ocean
    My love lies with the sea
    My love lies with the ocean
    My love lies with the sea
    My love lies with the ocean
    My love lies with the sea
    My love lies with the ocean

Commentary: |-
    <i>Tensei:</i>
    I'll have to do some explaining for this one: I've been messing around with vertically layered music composition, and wanted to do something with problem sleuth (that OTHER mspaint adventure). Feel free to skip my blathering below and just listen to the music though!

    I always felt like PS was at least partially a callback to 90s point 'n click adventure games along the lines of Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island, Sam & Max, etc. so this song is intended to reflect that. If you imagine PS as a video game, this is the song that would play at the very start of the adventure while our heroes are messing around in their offices and getting caught up in all kinds of shenanigans.

    Now, the nice thing about PS is that the three main characters (Problem Sleuth, Pickle Inspector and Ace Dick) all have some strong themes that make it easy to come up with appropriate musical motifs. In fact, the three musical instruments that appear fairly early in the comic ( A trumpet, a clarinet and a tuba) all are pretty obviously intended as metaphorical representations of the three heroes, which means that as a composer I have my work cut out for me.

    The idea with vertical layering in this song is that depending on which of the protagonists is currently 'on screen', the theme uses different motifs and lead instruments: when more than one protagonist is on screen their motifs are played at the same time and combined. Normal playback methods don't support this kind of interactive music (many game engines do, however), so this particular version is more of a proof of concept that just demonstrates the different layers and highlights how they interact.

    The first section after the intro belongs to Problem Sleuth. He's the leader of the bunch, and to reflect his mario-esque all-around average strength, his motif is played on a muted trumpet in the middle register with a combination of short and sustained notes.

    After that we come to Ace Dick. His motif consists of short notes played on a tuba and backed by trombones and timpani to throw some appropriate weight around.

    Pickle Inspector goes third with sustained notes played in the higher register of a clarinet. He's a bit of a loopy character so there's some glockenspiel and a lot of chroma... chromatics? chromaticity? to give it a bit of whimsy

    The fourth loop combines the motifs of all three characters to demonstrate the interaction between layers when all three are present. The final loop is a variation on the Problem Sleuth motif with an added theremin and a delay effect on all the instruments to give it a 'spacy' sound: we're entering the realm of imagination and the music becomes appropriately screwy.

    <b>Canned Corner: “Mother”</b>

    (aka. Music that didn’t quite make it. Since I’m not updating enough amma talk more about cancelled tracks you may have heard snippits of a while back but never appeared on any album)

    Aah “Mother”, this one was conceived back around [[album:homestuck-vol-9|Vol. 9]] as a Rose track, originally under the assumption that post-scratch Rose would be important and act as a kind of parallel to Rose’s Mom pre-scratch. As usual this wasn’t the case, and instead she surfed out on a blaze of glory and ICP related shenanigans.

    “Mother” was basically planned as post-scratch [[Harlequin]], but with flavours of Ms. Lalonde.  As such, it’s essentially [[Aggrieve]] in the style of Harlequin.  Then it’s blended more with my usual weird Chiptune-with-bits-of-orchestra thing.  The net result is kind of a more mystical, studious piece.

    I kinda like it, but it doesn’t really do anything, and its only original bits are abandoned fairly quickly due to the shortness of the track.  Plus when it became apparent that post-scratch Rose has pretty much no influence on the plot, it was brushed to one side and I started on something else.

    When I was young it seemed like everywhere was easy street
    Playing on my pogo ride, kicking back my feet
    And they were so simple I believed all that came
    But my mind still brittles since I borrowed this game

    And there is no here and no now
    Only what those mad gods have in store for us all
    Don't you wish you could just go back to the old days
    When all the truth was just the setting sun

    Forget about your past and forget about your future
    Like trees blown by the wind these things have no sway upon you
    Forget about your job and forget about your homework
    Now draw out your weapon and break it in two

    Forget about your life and forget about your world
    Just don't forget your friends cause they'll pull you through

    And there is no here and no now
    Only what those mad gods have in store for us all
    Don't you wish you could just go back to your old home
    Sitting on the roof, just to watch the setting sun

    Right around when [[album:cherubim|Cherubim]] came out in March, I got a few requests to hear what the original sketches were for [[Red Sucker]] and [[Green Lolly]]. These were the skeletons that I gave the team. I worked with them through the process with input and suggestions on the pacing and structure, but they really took these simple ideas and ran in the best possible direction!

    The cherubs are bizarre creatures, and everything about them is pretty far out there, so I focused on chromaticism in the themes to give it some off kilter base. Caliborn is (pardon my French) a little shit. He’s diabolical and selfish. I decided to base this skeleton on a minor triad to give it a darker tone right off the bat. Mirroring it on the Calliope sketch accidentally gave it a [Kuja’s Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAXn5t7WjkI) tone to it, which I ended up loving. I immediately approached [[artist:kalibration|Kali]] about adding his own personal flare to it. I’ve always been a monumental fan of his compositions, especially [[album:tomb-of-the-ancestors|TOTA]], which was the sound I was looking for. He nailed it exponentially!

   "Valor"

   A combination of the [[track:showtime-original-mix|original Showtime]] and [[track:dissension-original|Dissension]] I made to serve as a strife theme for Jake English a year ago. I was actually going to make strife tunes for all of the alpha kids, but I was worried that Valor might be feel repetitive with [[track:assault|Assault]] on the same album. Then Bowman made [[Elephant Gun]] and I just stopped working on it.

    Quest Accepted!

    Here’s a preview of what I’ve got so far. Not a huge amount of Karkat/Terezi injection in yet, or percussion for that matter, but I’m hoping to combine the two in some glorious union that will make even the hardest, strongest, man-horse-lusus be reduced to a pile of quivering tears and black liquid sorrow.

    <i>Circlejourney:</i> (wrote [[The Light's Rebellion]])
    so I just had a memory hit me out of nowhere - me and [[artist:serialsymphony|serialsymphony]] discussed quoting each other's tracks reciprocally back when Dave Strider's Cool Mixtape was meant to be on [[album:cosmic-caretakers]]. i.e. this track does reference [[track:the-lights-rebellion|The Light's Rebellion]] at 2:56
    we both made the front half of our tracks, and then traded motifs in the back half, so it really is a reciprocal reference
    sorry for your ears @ anyone who listens through this to confirm its existence

Lyrics: |-
    Yo, I was out for a while
    Cuz the red miles, Squarewave, get inside my sylladex
    Gotta fix shit now with a freestyle
    My team's a mess and it's all up to reflex

    Shit's kinda typical but this'll be mighty difficult cuz additional syllables
    Got a long road to hoe so let's go now acrobatic fucking pirouette

    C'mon I gotta go faster
    Yo, I'm a blur, colored alabaster
    Got that Crockercorp sendificator
    Absurd, I'm like my own flight simulator
    Zoom, speedyquick like my diction
    Do flips and shit, I'm twistin'
    Don't even care who's list'nin'
    Brace for impact I'm liftin'—
    Off, and I'm not even sweaty
    Though if I were, what I'd need'd be a towel
    Hey, yo, Sawtooth are you ready?
    Here comes a cruxite dowel (Nice catch!)

    Did I mention that I did this 'cause I gotta build speed, I'm relentless
    Gotta penchant, gotta mighty need like an engine, end of sentence; cool re-entrance

    (Yes.)
    (Fuck, yes.)
    (Hell, fucking, yes.)

    Oh
    Damn, a dead Roxy sans grave
    Yo Squarewave, take care of this place
    Now I know it's odd, but I gotta snog
    So go ahead and say it (Yeah dogg!)
    Dude, that's hella gay
    But hey I can't complain cuz the rogue is awake
    That's one down, two to go, or one
    If Roxy finds a way to partake
    (She won't. She's straight.)

    Fuck it, gotta move, Squarewave, see ya later
    Runnin' out of time, livin' on a prayer, got my
    Bucket and my Crockercorp sendificator
    Now as they say it's all gone pear shaped
    There's no other way
    So decapatation is my escape
    Goodbye Squarewave, ja mata ne (<i>see you later</i>)

    Yo, I'm back, did I miss shit?
    No I didn't, this attempt is kinda pathetic
    Doof, bitch, out the way
    Daddy Dirk is taking care of liplocking with Jane
    Looks like everything is okay
    One step left and we're headed to Jake
    Ya better hold on, because this thing is so fast
    Holy shit I'm cool

    (Did I tell you how cool I am? Cuz I am so fucking awesome.)
    (It's time for [Unintelligible])
    Grab on to my fucking skateboard, I'm so
    Cool, I saved the day, you're welcome watch this
    Cool shit that I set up earlier it's no
    Big deal, wait I lied it's actually the coolest thing ever!
    (Sup.)

    The four fanfares used in the different endings for [[album:friendsim-2-volume-1|Friendsim 2's]] prologue are variations on the same motif. Since they were all released simultaneously, we don't currently know the exact relationship between them, but in the meantime this track entry ensures they appear as being related to each other.

    As we near the end of Homestuck, please listen to this cover of [[artist:tensei|Joren "Tensei" de Bruin's]] "[[Heir of Grief]]" on saxophone.

    Since its beginning on April 13, 2009, Homestuck has accumulated over 8000 pages and 800,000 words and numerous characters. With End of Act 6's flash [S] Collide, the final act has begun. It's hard to believe that on April 13, 2016, the entire journey will be over.

Lyrics: |-
    (Four, tres, two, uno) Four, three, two, fuck you

    Listen up y'all, this shit is ironic
    Strider's beats are best suited to trolls hooked on phonics!

    Karkalicious definition, makes Terezi loco
    She wants to know the secrets that she can't taste in my photo
    Dyin' just to know the flavor, I ain't doin' HER no favors
    No reasons why I tease her flush just comes and goes like seasons

    I'm Karkalicious (So delicious)
    No I don't do kismesis
    And if you read any fanfics
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses (Mwah!)
    Don't matter if we're just moirails
    Trolls be lining down the veil
    For a chance to fill a pail (Four, three, two, fuck you)

    So delicious (Super sweet)
    So delicious (Fuckin' adorabloodthirsty)
    So delicious (Even Egbert wants a piece of me)
    I'm Karkalicious (Li-li-li-li-like candy, candy)

    Karkalicious def-
    Karkalicious def-
    Goddammit, Doc Scratch stop fucking around with my mic-

    Karkalicious definition, makes the shippers crazy
    Nepeta's always squealing cutesy pet names like Karkitty
    I'm the K to the A, R K the A the T
    And the MAJORITY of pairings had better include me

    I'm Karkalicious (So delicious)
    My body stays vicious
    All the highbloods feelin' nervous
    'Cuz I'm doing some fitness

    Zahhak's my witness
    Bet that ship curls Nepeta's tail
    And he'll be needing all the towels
    'Cuz I'mma make him sweat pails (Four, three, two, fuck you)

    So delicious (Super sweet)
    So delicious (Fuckin' adorabloodthirsty)
    So delicious (Even Egbert wants a piece of me)
    I'm Karkalicious (Now you nooksuckers hold the fuck up! Check it out)

    Baby, baby, baby
    If you really want me
    Honey get some patience
    Maybe then you'll get a taste

    I'll be tasty, tasty
    I'll be laced with lacey
    It's so tasty, tasty
    It'll make you crazy

    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D, to the E, to the, to the— I'll just spell it out for you!

    All the time I turn around trolls gather round, always sniffin' at me wanna guess the color of my blood
    I just wanna say it now I ain't trying to round up any drama, little fucker I just don't want you to know
    And I guess I'm coming off as just a little insecure although I keep on repeating how the secret's fucking awesome
    But I'm tryin' to tell, it's a secret that I just don't wanna tell

    Terezi says I smell delicious (So delicious)
    No I don't do kismesis
    And if you read any fanfics
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses (Mwah!)
    Don't matter if we're just moirails
    Trolls be lining down the veil
    For a chance to fill a pail

    (Four, three, two, fuck you) My body stays vicious
    Zahhak's been feeling nervous 'cuz I got down to business
    Nepeta's my witness (Meow!) I'll even let her first ship sail
    Just watch that kitten be the first in line to fill a pail

    So delicious (Eridan, see)
    So delicious (You can trust me)
    So delicious (I'll help you be)
    I'm Karkalicious (Li-li-li-like candy, candy)

    It's so delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    So delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    So delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    I'm Karkalicious (She says my blood is like candy, candy)

    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the— to the— to the— to the—

    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the— now wait just a motherfucking second!

    (Do I seriously have to spell this shit until the very end of the song? I mean, whoever fucking wrote the original never had access to spellcheck I guess, because T-A-S-T-E-Y does not spell TASTY. Was this Fergie douchemuffin illiterate or something? What do you mean human rap artists are the only ones brave enough to write their own grammatical train wrecks and call it music? What the fuck even is Will Smith doing? He doesn't throw down sick fires anymore? Fuck this shit, I quit!)

    Rustbloods, unite! Do not be content to keep your head down with this sax cover of [[artist:james-roach|James Roach]] & [[artist:toby-fox|Toby Fox]]'s "[[track:keep-your-head-down|Keep your head down]]" and "[[track:rustblood|Rustblood]]".

    This cover story was surprisingly difficult to do. Hiveswap (the long awaited sidequest for the Homestuck series) is very new, so there's a real possibility of spoiling things -- and this is especially the case since there are folks who are already familiar with Homestuck and folks who are not.

    This cover story could be like the prequel to the events of Hiveswap, maybe. Or at least, an imagining of something that could fit there.

Lyrics: |-
    Let me get straight to the point, I'm terminating your capriciousness
    I've got plenty of truth bullets to end you with a vicious diss
    I'll overcome your Rage-fueled antics, 'cuz I know that I'm better
    Than this dumb and slow juggalo borderline sexual predator
    Best be jotting notes, 'cuz I'm rocking Hope, leave you sobbing from my mocking
    You're a stoner joke, decaying all your lobes, and I my thought my brain was rotting
    Your plot armor can't save you here, this is your Final Dead Room
    So watch me make like Kanaya and split this jester in two

    Hey motherfucker. I was gonna have a pie but
    I'd love to teach you not to mess with motherfuckin' highbloods
    HONK. This motherfucker thinks he slays. Okay, bro
    Leave you dazed for days, motherfuckin' flayed with Faygo
    Motherfuckin luck man, how does it work
    Do you get it from being a motherfuckin' one-armed jerk?
    I'm motherfuckin immaculate. Leave you needin' an ambulance
    You winning in this rap-off? Now that's motherfucking miraculous

    Thank god that awful Act's over, you're getting no applause here
    All your "sick fires" were faker than you being god tier!
    Your chucklevoodoo nonsense ends up as a slurred blur, so
    Someone should ring Aranea and silence you like Kurloz

    Shit, motherfucker. That whole verse was motherfuckin' whack
    If miracles aren't fake you'll get off this motherfuckin' track
    Even if you motherfucked over Hinata and his class
    We know you'd motherfuckin' love to have his fingers in your ass

    I've had enough of this clown's jugglery, no matter how high you get you're under me
    In summary, I'll leave you under siege. Harpoon ya like your goat daddy underseas
    Leave you and your tacky clown crap like Chiaki. Crush every bone in your body
    This kid is depraved so I'll mimic Dave and end your Insane Clown Posse

    Your shenanigans are weak man, I motherfuckin' top em
    Seems this motherfucker's more suited to be "Ultimate Bottom"
    Leaving you subjugglated, ain't you a motherfuckin' sucker
    I didn't even need to sober up to beat you, motherfucker

    Metal joints and moving parts
    Radioactive, glowing hearts
    Send a code to change my mind
    No control, no way to fight

    I've been told what feelings are
    And the ones to show
    A splinter of my other self
    How close, we'll never know
    Shut me down, take me out
    Take these wires and burn them out
    Code me to break you, tell me to die
    Take my uranium, let the sparks fly
    Let my power run out
    Take my heart and shut me down

    Just a puppet to my code
    Quiet kind of binary ode
    Still I'm here, and I still feel
    I'm trapped inside a cage of steel

    I've been told what feelings are
    And the ones to show
    A splinter of my other self
    How close, we'll never know
    Shut me down, take me out
    Take these wires and burn them out
    Code me to break you, tell me to die
    Take my uranium, let the sparks fly
    Let my power run out
    Take my heart and shut me down

    I'm so cold
    Thirty seconds left before I explode
    Will I feel it when I die
    Will I wonder why

    Shut me down, take me out
    Take these wires, burn them out
    Code me to break you, code me to break you
    Code me to break you, code me to tell me to—
    Shut me down, take me out
    Take these wires, burn them out
    Code me to break you, tell me to die
    Take my uranium, let the sparks fly
    Let my power run out
    Take my heart and shut me down

    Beneath a smoldering sky crisscrossed with veins
    I rise from our ashes and I take the reins
    I won't allow this blood to stain

    I will not let us fall apart
    For what's a prince without his heart
    I'll play it fast I'll play it smart
    Synchronize

    And I'll escape the miles
    And I'll make Roxy smile
    I'll save the day in style

    And we'll survive
    You know if you guys die well that deprives
    Me of my heart and my spirit and my Strider stride
    And I ain't quite willing to lose all that tonight
    So let's fly

    Ship my head over to Jake for our very first kiss
    And I hadn't really planned that to go like this
    The volcano erupts he hears violins
    Lips meet mine

    And I'll escape the miles
    And I'll make Roxy smile
    I'll save the day in style

    And we'll survive
    Because a prince wakes up
    When you tear him apart
    Hurt my friends and break my heart

Lyrics: |-
    Gears spinning inside your head, silently
    Maybe make a body out of lead if you're ready and
    Lost inside a shell just a little bit proud of your genes
    But blood and breath and bones aren't as helpful as they seem so

    Build yourself a suit of armor
    Encase the heart that still beats fast
    Tighten screws and loosen wires
    And build a soul not made of glass

    It's an easy process if you're not seeing
    Tear yourself apart and pick up all the pieces
    Put 'em all back together with life and hope
    But you lost those 400 years ago

    An easy process if you're not believing
    There's a virus in your system but the trojan is deceiving
    And you find that you'd do anything, anything
    If your heart said go and do anything, oh

    Running throughout every vein, electricity
    And you're running out of fuel but you'll repair yourself at sea
    Talking to the ghost you can barely see
    But they left you all with nothing, but nothing's all you need so

    Build yourself a suit of armor
    Encase the heart that still beats fast
    Tighten screws and loosen wires
    And build a soul not made of glass

    It's an easy process if you're just seeing
    Tear yourself apart and pick up all the pieces
    Put 'em all back together with life and hope
    But you lost those 400 years ago

    An easy process if you're not believing
    There's a virus in your system but the trojan is deceiving
    And you find that you'd do anything, anything
    If your heart said go and do anything

    Well now the record broke, it's your time to shine
    But the gear's are off beat and you forgot the rhyme
    So let's bring it all back, do it one more time

    Gears spinning inside your head, silently
    Running throughout every vein, electricity
    So build yourself a suit of armor
    Encase the heart that still beats fast
    Tighten screws and loosen wires
    And build a soul not made of glass

    <i>KDMAnderson:</i> ([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kdmanderson/the-land-of-wind-and-shade))

    This is sort of a tribute tune to the Webcomic "MS Paint Adventures". It's very fresh; I recorded it almost as soon as I finished writing it. I slathered on Phasers, Chorus, Reverb and Echo to support the dreamy feel of the piece. It's played almost entirely with harmonics. Altered Tuning, too. ;)
    Enjoy!

Lyrics: |-
    Hello everybody!
    Let me tell you about Homestuck

    John Egbert, Rose Lalonde
    Ascend, descend, rise up, abscond
    Jade Harley, Dave Strider
    They all play Sburb and end the world
    Harlequin, Nanna, Bro
    Mom, Dad, Youth Roll
    Grandpa, Pesterchum
    Hella Jeff and Sweet Bro

    Heat and Clockwork, Wind and Shade
    Frost and Frogs, Light and Rain
    Vagabond and Mendicant
    Renegade, consorts, and Denizens
    Skaia, 413
    Countdown to the Reckoning
    Derse and Prospit, Carapaces
    Pogo Hammer, Sassacre

    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    Though it's weird and random, it's the greatest fandom
    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    True, it's quite outrageous, but it's so contagious!

    Jasper's secret, Davesprite
    Casey, Mutie, doomed timelines
    Good dog, best friend
    Jack causes many people's end
    Black Queen, Nak Nak
    Stuffing corpses, shoosh-pap
    Robot bunnies, Midnight Crew
    "H3Y COOL K1D, 1S TH1S YOU >:?"

    Lil' Cal, babies
    Ectobiology
    Apple juice, Pupa Pan
    Nic Cage, city of cans
    Doc Scratch, Snowman
    I warned you 'bout those stairs, man!
    God Tiers, march drag
    Who even is this douchebag?

    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    Though it's weird and random, it's the greatest fandom
    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    True, it's quite outrageous, but it's so contagious!

    Exploring with Aradia
    Tavros, Sollux, Nepeta
    Terezi's nuts, Karkat's a crab
    Gamzee's got issues with his dad
    Equius, Feferi
    Kanaya the vampire fashion queen
    She slices Eridan in half
    And Vriska is a badass

    Shipping charts, sick fires
    All the irons in the fire
    Buckets, squiddles, angels
    All the Lusi get culled
    Faygo, Recupercoons
    Horrorterrors kill you!
    Troll Jegus, killer clown
    Mobius double reacharound!

    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    Though it's weird and random, it's the greatest fandom
    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    True, it's quite outrageous, but it's so contagious!

    Matesprits, auspistice
    Moirail, kismesis
    Betty Crocker, ICP
    Dead Daves are the enemy!
    Green sun, Alpha-verse
    Jane, Roxy, Jake and Dirk
    UU, princely tights
    Guy Fieri is the Anti-Christ

    Captchalogue modus, and Strife Specibus
    Heir and Knight, Witch and Seer
    Can't outrun what's already here!

    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    Though it's weird and random, it's the greatest fandom
    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    True, it's quite outrageous, but it's so contagious!

    Dream bubbles, Shenanigans
    All who die come back again
    T1CK t0ck 8r8k H3ADS
    HONK honk, scary wolf heads
    Cue balls, magic dogs
    The universe is a frog
    Felt mob and fairies
    Lord English killed Hussie

    Troll cops, Thresh Prince
    Don't screw with the Condesce!
    Scalemates, rap wars
    Blowing up the Tumor
    Zillyhoo, shaving cream
    Echeladder, Science beam
    Cascade, Morse code
    This fandom's about to explode!

    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    Though it's weird and random, it's the greatest fandom
    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    And from now on, it will go on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on!
    You can't fight the Homestuck!
    Though it's weird and random, it's the greatest fandom

    things of the past
    found once again
    they will at last
    Flow in the Rain
    things come and go
    but, its not up to me
    all that we know
    now, everyone will see

    Rain
    Rain
    Rain
    Rain
    Flow in the Rain

    let us rewind
    back to the things that youve laid
    everything that youve shared with the hivemind (circling round and round, deep underground)
    your own creations, the things that you've made
    it all comes back and haunts
    this is what they want
    after all, its only humane
    all things you attain
    gently Flows in the Rain

    Rain
    Rain
    Rain
    Rain

    Flow in the Rain
    Flow in the Rain (Flow in the Rain)
    Flow in the Rain (Flow in the Rain)
    Flow in the Rain (Flow in the Rain)
    Flow in the Rain. (Flow in the Rain)

    So this song has kind of an upsetting backstory to it, when i was working on it one of the plugins crashed and basically deleted the entire file, that's why i wasn't able to mix this properly. It was also supposed to be used on [[album:stlap2|STLaP2]] but after what happened i decided not to add it. I hope you guys still enjoy it and thanks so much to Vilros Safron on HSA for commissioning me!

    And so finally, Ophiuchus is finished. I've been working on it since march, and now this 28 minute long prog rock homestuck epic is done. I had a lot of fun writing all this parts, although it's been quite hard sometimes. You can expect more prog rock songs like these in the future. Thank you all for listening.
