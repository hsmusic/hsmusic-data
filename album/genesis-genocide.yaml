Lyrics: |-
    Is Homestuck bad? Homestuck is SO bad! It's so extremely, very incredibly bad. Does Homestuck get better? Well... I mean, if- if it hasn't gotten better, maybe it nev- it won't at this point. BUT there's always a chance that it could get <i>worse</i>. So, umm... That's- maybe that's something to look forward to.

Lyrics: |-
    Chosen one of all existance
    Fascinated and discrowned
    His ways and grasp soluting
    Hear he say the sound
    The Black Blood

    Claws upon the raining
    Ripping down the flesh
    Ripping down the damned
    Reap the crops that fresh

    I can ever go to battle if i pray for name forgotten to the one

    As He calls
    The keeper of the Skulls of the fallen Trolls

    Eyes are decieving
    Hands are aside
    Wrath is rising
    Up to the size of skies

    In calling the one
    In having the throne
    Exists along
    His Honorable Tyranny

    Why all this a cycle
    Why all this the cost
    Why all this the menace
    I fill my soul
    With dead Miracles

Lyrics: |-
    Come on crawling
    Call to Empress
    May it leave
    In no cost
    The dissapearence
    Of another one unwisely fast

    I forgot how to act
    Our fault concieve to fall
    Humming martyrs
    Ready stride
    For the Wicked
    Over to die

    Our force
    Upon the world
    Will came to time
    To end the fight
    No one's fault
    To be devourd
    By one of Gods
    From beyond the worlds
