    <i>Homestuck:</i> ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358520/Pesterquest_Soundtrack/), excerpt)

    Enjoy the fine-grooving tunes of Pesterquest, the grimsical episodic visual novel adventure set in the darkly funny Homestuck universe.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    This soundtrack released exclusively on Steam as paid DLC for Pesterquest; it's got some quirks, discussed below, but is probably the best and only official release of Pesterquest's we'll ever see.

    Most tracks were originally composed by [[artist:james-roach]] for Pesterquest; almost all of his tracks were included on this soundtrack release, though six were not:

    - [[track:2chords]] ("Dave Route Prelude")
    - [[track:drone-pesterquest]] (not credited)
    - [[track:its-a-cover-of-made-of-time]] (not credited)
    - [[track:its-nothing]] (not credited)
    - [[track:mspar-remember]] ("Chaos Audio")
    - [[track:normal-song-name]] ("Afterw@rd Theme")

    Various tracks from prior releases were [[flash-act:pesterquest|featured throughout Pesterquest]]. Some of these were re-released on this soundtrack, while others weren't. Featured in Pesterquest from earlier Homestuck releases, and not on this soundtrack:

    - [[track:worst-end]], by [[artist:james-roach]] ("Prologue Theme")
    - [[track:end-of-friendvangelion]], by [[artist:james-roach]] (not credited)
    - [[track:superego]], by [[artist:yan-rodriguez]] ("Vriska's Theme")
    - [[track:bronze-rebel]], by [[artist:yan-rodriguez]] ("Tavros' Theme")
    - [[track:the-la2t-frontiier]], by [[artist:toby-fox]] ("Eridan & Sollux battle")
    - [[track:stress]], by [[artist:buzinkai]] and [[artist:toby-fox]] ("Dirk's Theme")
    - [[track:embittered-shore]], by [[artist:max-wright]] ("Reader's Theme")

    Pesterquest features several tracks by artists who weren't formally part of the Homestuck music team. Across the lists above and the main track list, these are tracks featured from the Homestuck fan community:

    - [[track:superego]], from [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]
    - [[track:indigo-heir]], from [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]
    - [[track:bronze-rebel]], from [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]
    - [[track:embittered-shore]], from [[album:lofam2]]

    [[album:hiveswap-friendsim|In Roachian fashion,]] most track names have slight (to significant) differences between their soundtrack release on Steam, individual track releases on SoundCloud, and the in-game credits list. All of these are noted on each track; on the wiki, the album's track list extracts the "main" part of the name of each track as part of the Steam release.

    The album cover artwork is from the Steam library; track artworks for select James Roach tracks are from their releases on SoundCloud.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    During the timeframe where this album hadn't yet been released on Steam, [[artist:tempest2k]] and other fans compiled the new tracks featured in Pesterquest into an album ready for anyone's music library, including full metadata and track artworks. This lacks the tracks featured elsewhere on Homestuck's discography, so it compliments the rest of a Homestuck library quite well.

    SO! PesterQuest is out. We've been sitting on this one for a while. [[flash:pq-vol1|This first route]] has been done for a while. It was supposed to come out back on 6/12 but our new publisher had us sit on it for reasons that are beyond even me. Anyway, big ups to [[artist:malcolm-brown|Malcolm]] and [[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark]] for letting me use their themes.

    I don't know if I'll have as much time or energy to do the tracks for pesterquest like i did for [[album:hiveswap-friendsim|friendsim]] since i got a new job. I will try my best.

    <i>James Roach:</i> ([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jamesroachmusic/pesterquest-please-support-the-trevor-project))

    I wasn't certain how to approach this one. I knew if I was going to use the theme from [[track:endless-climb|endless climb]] it wouldn't feel right accepting any money for it. These things don't exactly pay well to begin with tbh, so i thought I would use the platform i've been given to try and do something... even a little positive.

    at first the song was just going to be called "play the rain" because naming it something stupid, while keeping up with tradition, seemed like it would be in bad taste. at some point while i was working on it i started looking into various charities i could donate the proceeds to, and it hit me that i could just ask to make the title in the credits a link to the charity.

    suicide is something that is hard for me to talk about. its very personal. i tend to internalize feelings in order not to.. bother anyone. a few months ago i called a suicide hotline when i hit a really low point and i think just the act of calling made me feel... in charge somehow? feelings are fucked up. don't be afraid to talk to someone. even if it is a stranger at the other end of a call. take that step. you're not bad for feeling that way.

    so anyway. endless climb was one of the very first homestuck songs that really drew me in, and doing a cover of it all those years ago really got me back into taking composition seriously. it could easily be argued that this song changed my life for the better.

    if you want to know more about the trevor project, or just suicide prevention in general visit [thetrevorproject.org](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)

    jades theme! wow we've really come a long way huh fellas?

    i always really liked [[track:carefree-victory|carefree victory]] and its really one of the only songs that felt like uniquely hers. towards the end i try and do something that like... every homestuck musician i think tries at least once: getting all 4 of the kid's instruments to play something nice together. i think i did alright, i subbed in beatboxing for daves turntables cause its not like you can just carry those anywhere. i guess as opposed to johns piano?? LMAO

    musically i have jade start on bass, and as more of her friends come in she gets a little more confident in her basslines. anyway thats my fanfic.

    this is the last new piece i'll be doing for the forseeable future, or until i feel like doing another one which might be immediately. ive been doing this on a largely volunteer basis for a while since the budget constraints were tight and we need to pay the bg and sprite artists a reasonable amount. I wanted all four kids to have music by me and i think we'll be digging into the homestuck archive for other stuff.

    anyway i hope you've enjoyed the ride! its been a little bittersweet at times for me but i'll miss posting new stuff every two weeks.
