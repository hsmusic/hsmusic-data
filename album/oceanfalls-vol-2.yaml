Lyrics: |-
    (How am I gonna stop some big mean Mother-Hubbard from tearin' me a structurally superfluous new behind? The answer? Use a gun.)

    [??]
    
    This is America (Woo)
    Don't catch you slippin' now
    Look how I'm livin' now
    Police be trippin' now
    Yeah, this is America (Woo)
    Guns in my area
    I got the strap
    I gotta carry 'em

    [??]

    I am the one— I-I am the one
    Don't weigh a ton— don't-don't weigh a ton
    Don't need a gun— don't-don't need a gun
    To get respect up on the street

    I'm like, "Let's go play Minecraft"
    Can't keep my ores in my chest
    I don't have diamonds no more
    We're mining diamonds, you know

    I am the one— I-I am the one [??]
    Don't weigh a ton— don't-don't weigh a ton [??]
    I am the one— I-I am the one [??]
    Don't weigh a ton— don't— don't-don't-don't-don't-don't-don't— [??]
    I am the one— I-I am the one [??]
    Don't weigh a ton— don't-don't weigh a ton [??]
    Don't need a gun— don't-don't need a gun [??]
    To get respect up on the street [??]

    [??]

    (And if that don't work, use more gun.)
