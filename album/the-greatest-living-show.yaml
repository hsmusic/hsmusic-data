      <i>Fangamer:</i>
      On moonlit nights,
 
      Within this great fair, a carousal awaits.
 
      An audience of shadows, rocking in merriment
 
      To the greatest show, oh, perhaps the greatest ever been told.
 
      Dancers, perfumed in milk and honey
 
      Lyons, roaring like the orchestral pit
 
      And the ringmaster, with his most alluring smile...
 
      I, too, wish to stand upon his stage.
 
      <i>Toby Fox:</i>
      Allow me to tell you about something I'm very proud of.

      A while ago, I created a song with Itoki Hana called "THE GREATEST LIVING SHOW." For its release, I thought it would be nice to commission a music video from it from "Bani-chan", the album artist for our song "74." I gave her a loose outline of the story and a translation of the lyrics, and let her handle everything else.
 
      After two long years, the video has finally been completed.

      Over two long years, BANI created this entire music video from beginning to end, all by herself. Every frame, every pose, every camera angle, every character design, the effects, the processing, everything, was painstakingly done by her own hand.
 
      She worked chronologically from beginning to end. As its development went on, her abilities and standards raised higher and higher... ultimately compressing two years of hard work and improvement into a four-minute running time. You may notice this as you watch the video!

      Bani sacrificed her ____ and her ____ to bring you this. Now finally, she and her work stand in the spotlight before you. So please, put on your masks, raise your glasses... and behold! Now, in LIVE COLOR, the WORLD'S GREATEST SHOW...!

Lyrics: |-
     Aoku ureu tsuki ga
     Kajikamu mori o terashi dasu
     Soko ni haruka
     Himerareta
     Daremo shiranai butai ga
     Aru no

     (<i>The blue, melancholy moon
     Illuminates the bitingly cold forest
     There's a stage
     Tucked away
     That no one knows about</i>)

     "Akari touse"
     Kirameku kohaku to kage ga
     Doa o ikimajiru yoru
     "Akari touse"
     Odori ko-tachi wa saezuru
     Opaaru no kuchibashi de
     Nekkyou ni
     Michiru kyakuseki o
     (Showman) kare wa
     Kugutsu-tachi to miorosu
     Sono furi ageta
     Ude ni, maku ga ochita nara
     Saa, shou no hajimari da

     (<i>"Light it up!"
     This night of sparkling amber
     And shadowy figures lurking at the doors
     "Light it up!"
     These opal-beaked dancers
     Twittering like frenzied songbirds
     The showman looks down on his puppets
     With a flick of his wrist, the curtain falls
     Let the show begin!</i>)

     Raion ga hoe
     Kurutta rappa ga naku
     Watashi wa kyoufu ni hikareteiku
     "Saa, tobe !"
     "Mae !"
     "Karada yojirasete neji kireru made odore !"

     (<i>The lions are howling
     The mad trumpets are playing
     I am drawn towards this crazed fear
     "Come on, fly!"
     "Dance!"
     "Dance until your body twitches in pain!"</i>)

     Saikou no shou ga yondeiru
     Saigo no shou ga yondeiru
     Saikou no shou ga
     Kodomo-tachi no okiru jikan made

     (<i>The greatеst living show is calling
     The last chapter is calling
     Beforе all the little children wake up
     The greatest living show calls</i>)

     Chiisana makuma ni
     Hoshi akari ga kieta nara
     Tsukareta yakusha-tachi ga
     Retsu nashite hakeru
     Kemuri to kuyutta
     Tsumetai butaiura kara
     Kakedaseba asayakana
     Hikari ni deatta

     (<i>During the tiny intermission
     The starlight vanishes
     The exhausted actors
     Line up to leave
     From the smoky
     And stuffy backstage
     I ran out, and encountered
     A brilliant, vivid light</i>)

     Koi o shite
     Shiranai "anata" to warutsu o odoritai
     Daremo ga minna
     Mitorеru youna
     Sore wa suteki na ketsumatsu ga
     Aru no

     (<i>I'm falling in love
     I want to waltz with this "you" I don’t recognise
     The kind of dance that
     Everyone stares ata
     That would be a beautiful ending to this story
     Well, there is…</i>)

     "Akari tousе"
     Korusetto no yoruyami to
     (Showman) kare ni torawareteita
     "Akari touse"
     Amata no sasayaki ga hora
     Namae o yondeiru
     "Akari touse"
     Supankooru no doresu to
     Agaru iki wa mabayuku
     Keredomo, douda
     Watashi no engi wa, dokoka
     "Tadashiku" naiyou da

     (<i>"Light it up!"
     The Showman traps me in
     A corset of night and darkness
     "Light it up!"
     The many whispers are
     Calling my name
     "Light it up!"
     In a sequinned dress
     And a breath of blinding light
     What do you think of me?
     My performance seems to be
     Somewhat "improper"</i>)

     Kamen no otoko ga
     Gurasu o te ni warau
     Watashi wa butai o korogemawaru
     "Saa, tobe !"
     "Mae !"
     Karada yojirasete neji kire hikisakareru

     (<i>The masked man
     Laughs with a glass in his hand
     I roll about the stage
     "Come on, fly!"
     "Dance!"
     My body twists and turns and rips me apart</i>)

     "Saikou no shou da" koe ga suru (The last curtain is calling)
     Saigo no shou da koe ga suru (For the show to end)
     "Saikou no shou da" chigireteku (The last curtain is calling)
     Saigo no (For the show to end)

     (<i>"The Greatest Living Show" is calling (The last curtain is calling)
     The last chapter is calling (For the show to end)
     "The Greatest Living Show" is being torn apart (The last curtain is calling)
     The last… (For the show to end)</i>)
