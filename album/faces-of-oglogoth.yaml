Lyrics: |-
    So how's fast our paradise to come
    Many ways to live, many ways to drown
    We know how it goes as we se ones that not into the stoning to the prays of the One
    When this comes to rise of the horns
    When this faces the carnival call
    We well always make your way to our hands mostly flavourable as it once was
    When this comes to rise of the horns
    When this faces the carnival call
    We well always make your way to our hands mostly flavourable as it once was

    May the meal go on
    May it be the good on
    Or i get the bitching on and go up to destroy
    Call it kind of wise on
    So i can be right now
    Wrecking up this place and eating your refridge intacts

    Neverending ceremony of the meal cooking with me x8
    Carnival of Carnage
    Carnival of Carnage
    Carnival of Carnage
    Carnival of Carnage
    Coming of the ceremony the last of darkened tempers
    And capacity of fable now exists as vile real

Lyrics: |-
    So i have found out, that the peaceful solutions really exist
    Open throat, we wont need fret, right for now

    Dwelling in the burning blood
    Worshiping the burning sun
    Why cant you arise and shine
    In order of the One that was

    Remain the one reciever
    Of words
    Remain the one believer
    Of God that was
    Of God that was

    And remain the last recaller
    Of his true Name
    And voices of the prophets
    That worsphip soda cans

    Remain the one reciever
    Of words
    Remain the one believer
    Of God that was
    Condemn all world to drinking
    The fizzy bloody mass
    Remain the one believer
    Of God that was

Lyrics: |-
    What's makes the flesh
    So odd and fresh
    Honorary process
    Onwards, come next out the dark

    Lovely scent
    Meaning the death
    I will succeed
    And won't eat
    But not for me

    O, Great Golyb, Arise of your slumber
    Retake the trace
    And shred
    Disgrace of troll race

    O, Great Golyb, Denies this all
    Reap and sowing
    The cycle
    Persist it

Lyrics: |-
    Onwards onto no attrition
    Affirate upon the "Burning Ground"
    Horrors beyond mine compression
    Are hunting us oblitioning of distorting sounds
    Spinal
    Cervice
    Extraction
    of Genitails!
    Madness of the last stand brinks the eye

    Spinal Cervice Extraction

    Clockhand smashed face

    Turning bloody more on lieaking

    Free is Night
    This is It
    Time has come

    So i am already here
    So i am already here
    So i am already here
    So i am already here

    Oh my, oh my desired friend
    Forbidden and desept
    My beautiful redemption of decay
    Is now condemned to set
    My fucking leg
    Dismembered
    But now i feel myself better
    Foregin, but
    Not lost my hand
    I am alredy happened

Lyrics: |-
    Millions obey
    Obeying the one
    Submerged by round of pain
    Of reek, of smoldering rain on grave
    Of smoldering rain of pain

    What begins with plague
    What begins with plague
    What begins with plague
    What begins with plague

    Terminality of mind
    Terminality of treads that bind us
    Terminality of madness
    But grasp is strong and never will let us

    What begins with plague
    And ends with burning flames
    What begins with plague
    And ends, we can explain
    And ends, we can explain
    And ends, we can explain
    And ends, we can explain
    And ends, we can explain
    And ends, we can explain
    And ends, we can explain
    And ends, we can explain

Lyrics: |-
    Oglogoth, the destroyer of worlds
    Speaker of wrath and tormenting force
    Oglogoth, the speaker of right
    Oglogoth, sentences you die

    Oglogoth calling us nigh
    Speaking the vast
    Reading the mind
    Horrors of day
    May let him smile
    Oglogoth, resting till
    Rise
    Torment to struck
    Torment to ride
    Torment to ride

    Oglogoth
    Oglogoth

    Are the fectures
    Fall in lie
    Oglogoth, for fetch, they die

    Nightmare
