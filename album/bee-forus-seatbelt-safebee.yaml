    [[artist:blackhole|Blackhole (Not-Terezi-Pyrope)]] and the Beforus Q&A Team proudly present;
    <b><p style="font-family:'Comic Sans', 'Comic Sans MS', cursive">seatbelt safebee</b></i>
    A collaborative meme album, with 12 all-new tracks and original dialogue written by [[artist:blackhole|Blackhole]] and [[artist:magnoliajades|Magnoliajades]].
    Commentary booklet assembled by [[artist:circlejourney|Circlejourney]].<br>
    Track commentaries pulled from our Skype chat log. The Seatbelt Safebee album and related media are brought to you by memes.<br>
    Homestuck, Undertale, Dark Souls and The Bee Movie are the property of their respective creators.<br>
    Special thanks to [[artist:squid|Squid]] and [[artist:gilwing|Gilwing]] for letting us use their art, and [[artist:veritas-unae|VeritasUnae]] for hosting the tracks.

    <b>About this album</b>
    The Cronus Seatbelt Safety meme was born during the livestream of the [[album:beforus|Beforus album]], during the track [[track:land-of-cruisin-and-bruisin|Land of Cruisin and Bruisin]] by [[artist:nate-tronerud|Nate Tronerud]]. Tumblr user princeskytoe remarked upon Cronus' lack of a visible seatbelt in the track art, which resulted in various users joking about his disregard for road safety and the fact that he was "cruising for a bruising".
    Bee memes made an appearance during the Beforus Album stream when album director and stream manager [[artist:blackhole|Blackhole (Not-Terezi-Pyrope)]] imposed various bee images over the booklet pages being shown in the stream, causing users to flood the stream chat with exclamations about bees.
    Soon after the Q&A session, the artists from the Q&A Skype group got talking, composing, and drawing. Six days later, we had an album on our hands.
    Ladies, gentlemen, and non-binary folks: Bee-forus: Seatbelt Safebee.

Lyrics: |-
    (It's been a long, hard day. You're walking down to the shops to buy yourself a glass a nice cool glass of lemonade.)
    (Ahh...)
    (And you seem to have lost your way. Where the shop should be, there is a beehive, and where there should be a shopkeeper, there is a bee. You approach the bee. He looks up with a menacing pincer snick. You're lost, you explain. You wonder if the bee could direct you to the lemonade. Sweet, sweet lemonade.)
    (Ahh...)
    (The bee looks at you. His mandibles widen. He begins to emit a swarm of yet smaller bees. They surround you, coating your clothes and hair, and infesting your various orifices with their warm, fuzzy mass. Don't worry, says one of the bees, whispering softly into your ear.)
    (Don't worry.)
    (There is nothing to fear. We are merely bees and bees are your friends.)
    (Don't bee afraid.)
    (You don't understand. All you wanted was some lemonade, its sweet icy coolness.)
    (Ahh...)
    (But now, that life is gone, and the whole world is bees. They are coating the room now.)
    (Don't fight it.)
    (They cover everything, filling it, filling you, with bee. Join us, they say, their voices a chorus of mournful buzzing. The soft cadence of the noise seems to hang poised in the air, forcefully penetrating your ears, your skull, your mind.)
    (Join us.)
    (Join us, say the bees, and you realise, you're one with the bees. This skin, this shell, is nothing but a minor barrier between you and the bees. You are bees. Glorious crescendo of buzzing rises under your skin! You are a swarm, rapturous melding of mind and form of bees dissolving to the sound in the air, a choir become one with its music, a phoenix of bees risen to take on a greater yet higher form! You let yourself go. You become one with the bees. You are a bee.)

Lyrics: |-
    (Ladies and gentlemen, and everyone in between and otherwise, I'm here to tell you a story, about a certain man who did not know how to properly wear a seatbelt. That young man's name was Cronus Ampora, and one day he was driving his car, otherwise cruising and bruising, without wearing a seatbelt as mandated by Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. In just a short time, through a series of trials and tribulations that would affect him on this day, he would discover the secrets of seatbelt safety, and have a convertive and serious motor vehicle accident because he was unfastened within the vehicle. This is the story of that journey of self-discovery that would affect him for the rest of his life. All of you, I hope you enjoy.)

    (Oh no, not the bees, not the bees! AAAAAAH!)

    (<i>~Stara:</i>) (bee?)
    just sample traffic and the gross sounds seatbelts make when you rub them against themselves

    (I'm not joking. Wear the belt, or you'll die.)
    (Bu-bu-but bu-bu-but!)
    (You'll die, Cronus. I'm saying right now, because the bees... they're going to get you, and you'll die.)

    (Oh, for god's sake!)

    Hey there, hello mister Safety Bot
    Is that a belt that you have strapped on?
    You're teaching Cronus how to buckle up
    But afterward I'll unfasten you

    Unlike other robots, you're concerned
    For our safety, and that's attractive
    Though what's safety without some danger
    If you'd like, then I'll unfasten you

    You make my motor run, keep it on
    I could be the belt to your buckle
    You make my horn go [BEEP BEEP], do it again,
    I could be the belt to your buckle

    (Watashi wa anzen botto no dikku wo suushitai desu.)
    (Wait, hey, hang on, what are you doing with those bees?)

    (Damn it, Safety Bot! Why are you so bad at fighting bees? And why are you so good in bed? Mmm-mmm!)
    (Yeah, how could bees defeat a robot anyway?)
    (Because bees have the power of determination.)
    (Oh god, vwho the fuck are you?)
    (I am the voice of the bees, and I'm here to tell you more about the bees.)

    According to all known laws of aviation
    There is no way a bee should be able to fly
    Its wings are too small
    To get its fat little body off the ground
    The bee, of course, flies anyway
    Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible
    (Impossible. Impossible. Impossible. Impossible. Impossible. Impossible.)

    (Bee! Bee! Bee! Bee! Bee!)
