    Written in 2014, The Fall only recently was premiered in April of 2016.

    The Fall is written for a women's choir in four parts (divisi, eight lines) and utilizes and old Scottish Gaelic poem.
Lyrics: |-
    As the rain hides the stars,
    As the autumn mist
    Hides the hills,
    As the clouds veil
    The blue of the sky, so
    The dark happenings of my lot
    Hide the shining of thy face from me.
    Yet, if I may hold thy hand in the darkness,
    It is enough, since I know,
    That though I may stubmle in my going,
    Thou dost not fall.

    Soliloquy was written for solo viola and electronics in the Spring of 2015. It was premiered on viola at the call for scores winners concert at the 2016 Open Space Festival of New Music in Greeley, CO. It is dedicated to my good friend Abi Evans and all of her help in creating it.

    For this performance, it was adapted for cello and electronics and performed by Brett Andrews. Both versions are available.

    The idea for the piece came from thinking of how to blend a string instrument with electronic playback. My solution was to record a viola and put the recordings through filters, samplers and oscillators. Midway through is a repurposed old vinyl recording of a viola concerto that I also manipulate through an oscillator. The hope was to make a more organic connection between the playback and the soloist.

    Sand Molding was composed in late 2015 and premiered at the University of Northern Colorado in April of 2016. The premiere performance was by Jeff Perry and Breana Meyers.

    Sand Molding explores the process of, well, using sand to mold iron and steel. Throughout the composition, the sounds of metal overtake the sounds of wood as the natural becomes the artificial.

    The piece is written in seven sections that repeat in one large arc. Each section continues to become more aleatoric until the mid point is reached before the piece wraps back to the beginning.

The piece was premiered in November of 2015 at the Currier Inn in Greeley, CO by Jordan Ortman. This recording is from April of 2016, Jordan Ortman.
    
    Toward Eternity is a journey through death. Inspired by Emily Dickinson's famous poem Because I could not stop for Death. The piece goes through the emotions of acceptance of death from the departed. From the fear of the unknown, to the nostalgic pull of past memories, finally to acceptance.

    <i>James Dever:</i>
    New Irish Stew is a graphic score written in early 2016 and premiered in April of the same year. The piece is written for three indeterminate musicians and two narrators.

    The score is written in a literal circle with no beginning or ending given. It is up to the performers to decide where to start, when to end, what tempo, and if they wish, when to improvise.

    Surrounding the music is a slew of cherry picked quotes from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. The narrators can either be cued by the outer, melodic line, or free to choose when to quote each line. The other voices heard besides the two narrators are audience members who were given specific quotes and told to say them whenever they wanted.

    The premiere was performed at the University of Northern Colorado by guitarist Conner Shaw, marimbist Breana Meyers, bassist Ben Hornacek, and narration by Joe Darpino and Cathy Verbyla.
