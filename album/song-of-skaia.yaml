    Another [New Year's Eve](https://www.homestuck.com/story/3220) gone by, another [ball dropped](https://www.homestuck.com/story/4413).

    Here is [[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark Hadley's]] single, Song of Skaia. It's good! Hadley is responsible for such HS songs as [[Harlequin]] and [[track:blackest-heart|Blackest heart]].

    You might have noticed I've scaled back the frequency of music releases somewhat. It was becoming sort of intense getting one or more albums ready for release every month. It also did start to feel like *maybe* just a little bit too much music coming at you all the time. I'd like to make sure the novelty of these doesn't deteriorate too quickly. Hence a single release seemed like a nice way to mix it up for now. I would expect albums to come out closer to every two months from now on.

    On that note, I'll make an announcement about plans for the next album shortly. Preemptive tl;dr - it will be a contest. Details soon.

Lyrics: |-
    In vento cogitatio, spirat in vento<br>E vacuo lux elucet, lux e vacuo<br>E somno somnia cre'ta, somnia e somno<br>In clara umbra creatum versat
    (<i>Thought blows in the wind, in the wind<br>Light shines from the void, light from the void<br>Dreams awaken out of sleep, dreams out of sleep<br>Creation twirls in a bright shadow</i>)
    In vento spiritus flat, spiritus in vento<br>In fusco lumen ignescit, lumen in fusco<br>E somnis verita nata est verita nata<br>E nihil omnia cre'ta sunt omnia creata
    (<i>Spirit flows in the wind, spirit in the wind<br>Light burns in darkness, light in darkness<br>Truth is born out of dreams; truth is born<br>All is created out of nothing; all is created</i>)
    Pel Amar vinya-onant<br>Feä raniel vilyadessë sira
    (<i>Around the new-born world<br>Wandering spirit flows in the wind</i>)
    Lindelë sama calad<br>Oloriello illuvë onant<br>Eä
    (<i>Music joins light<br>All is born from a dream<br>Let it be</i>)
    In vento cogitatio, spirat in vento (Pel Amar)<br>E vacuo lux elucet, lux e vacuo (Vinya-onant)<br>E somno somnia cre'ta, somnia e somno (Feä raniel)<br>In clara umbra creatum versat (Vilyadessë sira)
    In vento spiritus flat, spiritus in vento (Lindelë)<br>In fusco lumen ignescit, lumen in fusco (Sama calad)<br>E somnis verita nata est verita nata (Oloriello)<br>E nihil omnia cre'ta sunt omnia creata (Illuvë onant, eä)
