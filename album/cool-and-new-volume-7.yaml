    <i>Makin:</i> (team manager)
    I believe the art for this was submitted by an anonymous artist in 2012, intended to be the album art for [[album:lofam2]]. It instantly became a meme due to its outside artist-esque look.
    The letters were added by a different artist, also lost to time.

    I'm not british, I'm just gay
    That's my character, I'm the trashman! I come out, I throw trash all over, all over the ring.
    And then, I start eating garbage. And then I pick up the trash can and I, smash the guy on the head.
    Oh, that's gonna be a disaster.
    No, nobody's gonna get hurt, I'm telling ya, like you said, it's all fake.

    GameBro, GameBro, GameBro, GameBro, GameBro (Your move! Your move! Your move! Your move!)
    GameBro! (Your move!)

    It's GameBro! (Your move!)

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    GameBro! (Your move!)
    It's GameBro! (Your move!)

    It's time to Du-du-du-du-dudududududuGame Bro!

    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe
    So, come on, and let's go!

    It's GameBro! (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

    I miss the old Hussie, the pre-GO Hussie
    The [unintelligible] Hussie, Kickstarter goals Hussie
    I hate the new Hussie, the no news Hussie
    The you drool Hussie (?), the Davekat rules Hussie
    I miss the sweet Hussie, making a beat Hussie
    I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Hussie
    See, I invented Hussie, it wasn't any Hussies
    And now I reckon around and there's so many Hussies
    I used to love Hussie, I used to love Hussie
    I even had the Space hoodie, I thought I was Hussie
    What if Hussie made a comic about Hussie?
    Called "Cool and New Web Comic"?
    Man that'd be so Hussie
    That's all it was Hussie, we still love Hussie
    And I love you like Hussie loves Vriska

Lyrics: |-
    Two to the one, from the one to the three
    I like good pussy and I like good tree
    Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
    And I get more ass than a toilet seat
    Three to the one, from the one to the three
    I met a bad bitch last night in the D
    Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
    Conversation and Hennessy
    I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
    Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
    If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
    And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
    Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
    It's real easy, just follow the beat
    Don't let that fine girl pass you by
    Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

    We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up!)
    Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt!)
    I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut

Lyrics: |-
    Two to the one, from the one to the three
    I like good pussy and I like good tree
    Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
    And I get more ass than a toilet seat
    Three to the one, from the one to the three
    I met a bad bitch last night in the D
    Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
    Conversation and Hennessy
    I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
    Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
    If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
    And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
    Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
    It's real easy, just follow the beat
    Don't let that fine girl pass you by
    Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

    We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up!)
    Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt!)
    I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
