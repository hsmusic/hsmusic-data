    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    i'ts album fro cool and new web comic
    its the IIth one

    <i>ostrichlittledungeon:</i>
    Having spent hours and hours mastering these two albums, I've been able to listen to every single track and appreciate all 102 of them. Not that I particularly appreciated every single one. In any case, I'd like to thank each and every music team member who contributed to this release as well as every art team member who provided the brilliantly done artwork found throughout both albums. Special thanks to [[artist:o|o]], once again, for writing the comic that has inspired us all. I'm glad to be part of an effort to keep a dying webcomic alive through a tradition of music, artwork, and most importantly of all, friendship and community. Thank you for downloading this album. We wouldn't have been able to do this without you and everyone else who hit that button on either bandcamp or mega.nz.

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    I'm just pointing out that this whole 50 track album came out two and a half hours after [[album:cool-and-new-volume-2|our previous 50+ track album]].

Lyrics: |-
    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the best thing about morning
    Those colorful enchanting little specks
    They make my taste buds spring to life without the slightest warning
    In a way they never do when I eat Chex

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the breakfast I've been cravin'
    I shove 'em by the fistful in my trap
    They got vitamins and nutrients and even riboflavin
    And make Cocoa Puffs look like a bowl of crap

    Yeah Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are a breakfast taste sensation
    They're tiny tasty munchable and sweet
    I'd like to start a bloody war and build a Pebbles nation
    And murder every other breakfast treat

    And the gallows will sway through the night
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    All cereals bow down in fright
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Sycophants and cowards flee
    From Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Captain Crunch on bended knee
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    The balance of the world's askew
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Promise revolutions new
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    What cereal 'mongst other things
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Stays crunchy in the blood of kings?
    It's Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    (Still going. Riding that Pebble train!)
    City-states and emirates and commonwealths and counties
    Imagine how they will react with glee
    As the early dawn reflects upon all nature's greatest bounty
    Of soybean oil and red dye number three

    Oh ministers and magistrates can't stop the people's yearning
    For the turning of the powers yet to be
    And presidents and potentates can't stop the fires burning
    As we cast their ivory towers to the sea

    And the creatures of the forest hark
    To Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Noble stag and yellow lark
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    The innocence of children's eyes
    And Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Will watch that Fruity flag rise
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    United we shall march along
    With Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Some shall die but we'll fight on
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    The fife shall play its soaring note
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    We'll slit every dissenting throat
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    This vow for glory we must keep
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Though God himself may turn and weep
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Do not fear the cleansing flood
    Of Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    A breakfast table stained with blood
    And Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

Lyrics: |-
    I hate a moral coward, one who lacks a manly spark
    I just detest a man afraid to go home in the dark
    I always spend my evenings where there's women wine and song
    But like a man, I always bring my little wife along!

    I'm a member of the Midnight Crew
    I'm a night owl, and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song!
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the Midnight Crew!

    The fun it doesn't stop 'til 12 on happy old Broadway
    So what's the use of going home, until the break of day?
    Now, something confidential, whisper not above a breath
    I once went home at 2 AM, and scared my wife to death!

    I'm a member of the Midnight Crew
    I'm a night owl, and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song!
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the Midnight Crew!

    I never shall forget the night I made six robbers run
    Although I didn't have a knife, a blackjack, or a gun
    I proved myself a hero of a very high degree
    I ran for home, and six of them, were running after me!

    I'm a member of the Midnight Crew
    I'm a night owl, and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song!
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the Midnight Crew!

Lyrics: |-
    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Well come on, get ready, get set, and here we go

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    You've gotta be ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing
    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact

    Do it!
    Do it!
    Do it!
    Do it!
    Do it, do it, do it do it!
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe
    So, come on, and let's go!

    Uh!
    Uh!
    Uh!
    Uh!
    Alright!
    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    You've gotta be ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing
    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    It's GameBro!
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games—

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop...

Lyrics: |-
    (Oh my fucking God I can't believe that this shitty volume has 100 songs. To celebrate, I have decided to share with you a [[track:bowmans-credit-score|friend's credit score]], which can save you a lot of money. Do you know what it is?) (No.) (Nevermind then. Let's talk about what a Cool and New Web Comic [[artist:o|o]] has made that has enriched our lives. Whether you enjoy it ironically or unironically, I say that CaNWC is an experience that has made us forget our worries and has given us great memories. So, the [[group:canmt|CanWC Volume two team]] would like to say thank you to o, and good luck with the rest of the comic. Now, enjoy the rest of the album you memers.)
