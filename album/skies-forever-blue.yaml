       <i>Toby Fox:</i>
       When I released UNDERTALE, I wondered if the game would reach RPG fans in Japan... So, after the game released, I was quite happy when one of my first fan letters was from a Japanese fan. This fan's name was Itoki Hana.

       I actually recognized her from the Kirby vocal covers she put on YouTube, and my friends told me "you should talk to her!" After a few messages, she said she wanted to send me a gift, so I gave her my address. Eventually, I got a package at my house, containing chocolates and a hand-sewn patch of Flowey. The chocolates were some Japanese-exclusive flavors and they tasted really bad. They might've also been expired on arrival. Anyway, the handmade patch she made was really cute and I still have it. Since then, I consider her one of my good friends, and every once in a while we make music together. please, put on your masks, raise your glasses... and behold! Now, in LIVE COLOR, the WORLD'S GREATEST SHOW...!

       This time we made a song called "Skies Forever Blue".

       The music video was handled by OMOCAT LLC, who you may know as the creators of OMORI! We made the video in quite a rush, but it was fun to be able to work together on something. Many other people helped out too, so check the credits.

Lyrics: |-
      Seems our journey is now through
      All is saved in thanks to you
      There was something I should say but
      Surely it can wait another day

      Since I laid my eyes on you
      Skies have been forever blue
      Two friends started just as neighbors
      That is why to say this will take time

      Ever since the day we met a parcel of my mind's lost to you
      When you made my name the same just as the one you love, then I knew
      Maybe to your view I'm just a faintly colored hue that's alright
      Even if the only things you say are yes or no I'll see blue sky

      So with our final time
      Shall I say my line
      Pray this time my heart will shine on through
      Which finally, in finalty, isn't true

      Since I laid my eyes on you
      Skies have been the bluest blue
      Now that everything is breaking
      Let me say the same thing one more time

      How you do and where you been and why you never call, say it all
      Long as all the words you say are going straight to me, I'm enthralled
      Feelings flowing out across the screen until the bat'try runs dry
      Even if the only things you say are yes or no I'll see blue sky
      
      So with our final time
      Shall I change my line
      Bare it all and cry and show the truth
      To finally say finally, I love you
