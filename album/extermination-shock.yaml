    Extermination Shock's demo is out as part of Steam NEXT fest! I did a bunch of work on the music and sound for this. If space dogfights sounds like your jam, give it a try!

    [(Bandcamp link)](https://what.bandcamp.com/album/extermination-shock) The original soundtrack for Extermination Shock is now up on my bandcamp!

    The soundtrack will be available on steam as well in a few weeks, once Valve approves the store page for it anyhow.

    [(Steam link)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510820/Extermination_Shock/) I completely neglected to update my tumblr with this, but Extermination Shock, the dogfightin' space sim I've been making the music for for a few years is out now! Take a look if it sounds like your thing!

    Oh, and if you’re interested in the soundtrack, it’s available on my bandcamp at [(Bandcamp link)](https://what.bandcamp.com/album/extermination-shock)
    It’ll be available on Steam as well once Valve finishes reviewing the store page! Expect that in a few weeks!
