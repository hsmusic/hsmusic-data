    <i>Cecily Renns:</i> (Mastered the Album)
    This album is extremely great, but why its really brought to perfection is that a whole THREE songs reference We are Number One from LazyTown. 
    This album is about Homestuck, i swear

    <i>tripheus:</i> (Album Artist)
    Since cool and new homestuck is blending hmestuck and canwc together, i thought id reflect that in the album art

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Commentator)
    Can you find the corrupted Jane i made months back in this picture? Once you find it the whole track art—no, the whole soundtrack—becomes infinitely better

    <i>Interrobang:</i> (Commentator)
    Let it be known that I made the majority of this booklet while watching hit film <i>The Room</i>

Commentary: |- 
    <i>Cecily Renns:</i> (Composer, referring to all disc transition tracks)
    I wanted to try something different this time, so the idea was to add a new instrument with each transition, and the instruments start to layer on top of each other, but with 8 transitions that would've been just hectic, so it just became "it gets more and more busy until rex"

    <i>Cecily Renns:</i> (Composer)
    This song actually went through some multiple iterations(i never do that, lol), but basically this song is me fanboying over Homestuck Anthem, my favorite track in the HS discography, and trying to make a song that resembles it (it probably went well)

    <i>Shadok:</i> (Artist)
    cookiefonster gave me this idea of "the alpha kids in rolling coasters" for another track except the spot was already taken, so i did it for this

    <i>Koba:</i> (Composer)
    So i wanted to contribute to this album since i wasn't able to contribute to the first CANHS album, so at first i was being super ambitious song, then i forgot that i am bad at making decent sounding songs so i made a soundfont swap with a mess of pokemon stuff in it instead (i think it went well but to be perfectly fair it's literally just a soundfont swap with a 1 motif put in and one clip of a song roughly put in too) so i hope you enjoy it

    <i>loading:</i> (Commentator)
    Why do i even get commentary, I lost my song spot

    <i>StarlightCalliope:</i> (Artist)
    Litten isn't the best starter of Gen 7. It's time to stop, Koba. It's final evolution isn't cool. Just... no.

    Made this song cus i love even in death, tried to get as far away from even in dance as i could while keeping somethings. Thats why i used the same synth for the lead, Massive.

    <i>jakkyr:</i> (Artist)
    Here is a story all about how my life got flipped strait upside down, now let me take a moment sit right there and i'll tell you about the story where i have school for like 8 hours a day, following with me sleeping up to 14 hours at this point because my vitamin d is stabilizing slowly and the rest of the time i worked on this... or well i also used hours on playing warframe with a friend and then i also playd overwatch. and then i playd a lot of heroes of the storm for the oni genji skin and found out it was a good game so we kept playing. oh and then there was was the time we playd terraria a for like 2 days straight. but other then that i worked on this. its inspired from the even in death track art and reapers halloween highlight intro. tbh i'm not quite sure how i did most of this i just tried my way and it ended up looking nice. i'm still questioning how i got the skull how i got it but whatever i guess. \*9 hours later* got a bunch of help from like my only irl artist friend because the styles didn't go together with what i made, but now i made it look like it fit together (the coffins + reaper rose with literally the rest of the art) ty lenny

    <i>SplitSuns:</i> (Composer)
    Wheals was gracious enough to let me work on this song, and I'm glad he did. Thyme on my Fries was a lot of fun to make from start to end. Putting in [[track:axel-f-crazy-frog|the Crazy Frog song]] (you know the one,) Extraterresterial, Waters of Nazareth, and all those standard Homestuck leitmotifs you know and love into a re-instrumentated-from-scratch package that I hope does the original justice was a treat. That “”guitar solo”” at the end was all improvised and I think it turned out pretty well. I knew I couldn't hope to match [[group:tensei|Tensei's]] skill so I just threw caution to the wind and hoped for the best. In the end, I'm satisfied with my first CANH song and I hope you all are too.

    <i>Wheals:</i> (Wheals)

    I dont know if you guys realized this but decapitation seems to be a thing with dirk. i thought the idea of dirk juggling a bunch of heads was kind of cool. thats about it

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Composer)
    [[track:another-jungle|Another Jungle]] is a criminally underrated song, which is why I'm glad I took it and ruined anyone else's chances at remixing it. As with [[track:cool-and-new-anthem|cool and new Anthem]], this is me fanboying over a song and making one that resembles it. It doesn't actually quote anything though which is pretty cool.

    <i>NyashAlex:</i> (Artist)
    This shot was taken on a beautiful friday sunset, because I felt like the sunset's lighting would blend well with the colors of the Condy's ship (but VSCOCam's preset sorta ate the colors, welp). Also, because I wanted to be done with this asap (that's why it wasn't taken on a saturday afternoon).

    Stealing old art and pasting bullshit on it is truly the spirit of high effort collaboration.

    Griever made the original, cookie added some robot heads, i replaced them with more(??) relevant heads.
Lyrics: |-
    I hate a moral coward one who lacks a manly spark
    I just detest a man afraid to go home in the dark
    I always spend my evenings where there's women wine and song
    But like a man I always bring my little wife along

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew
    Wawawawawawawawawawa

    The fun it doesn't stop 'til 12 on happy old Broadway
    So what's the use of going home until the break of day?
    Now something confidential whisper not above a breath
    I once went home at 2 AM and scared my wife to death

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew
    Wawawawawawawawawawa

    I never shall forget the night I made six robbers run
    Although I didn't have a knife a blackjack or a gun
    I proved myself a hero of a very high degree
    I ran for home and six of them were running after me

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew

    <i>Interrobang:</i> (Composer)
    When I signed up for this spot a while back, I immediatly knew I wanted it to be two seperate songs, one for each 'half' of the flash, that flowed in and out of each other. As I began to plan stuff out I chose to cover two songs that I really really liked, which at the time happened to be Unite Synchronization and [[track:boss-battle-pokemon-typing-adventure|Learn With Pokemn Typing Adventure Boss Battle]]. So, this monstrosity is the result of that, and I think it turned out pretty well.

    I was bored and wanted to see what had spots open on the spreadsheet, chose this because gold pilot is a good song. for the track art i kinda combined the different things this song was about - the glitched entry to the alpha session and sollux's ancestor - no becquerel unfortunately since i forgot the fact that gold pilot was originally a bec song before the title change while i was making this. fun fact: the code in the background was made by me dicking around in hackertyper and screenshotting it

    I based this on a Caliborn artwork because there's not enough art of Jhon looking like the evil bastard he actually is. I like to ignore this is based on Game Over and pretend it's the soundtrack for a 4 minute animation of Jhon killing everyone and dooming the session.

    Ugh, [[track:pipeorgankind|Pipeorgankind]]. The tempo is nowhere near steady. I basically had to play bits and then line them up with each other, which I guess kind of fits how the original sounds?

    <i>william_:</i> (Artist)
    I actually had to PLAY rct2 - gasp! - in order to figure out what the ice cream shop looked like in that game. (i am dedicated to my craft!) i like to think that this is what the planet created by rose and hecka's SBURB session would look like, just a massive game of rollercoaster tycoon - though without typheus' lair being there, of course.

    <i>Starlight Calliope:</i> (Composer)
    Originally, [[artist:makin]] had signed up to do this song for CANH. At around early-mid October he offered up the spot, and I took it. I played around with several ideas, including remixing Hello Zepp in a polka style similar to [[track:reveilleawesome-sad-polka-mix-with-gong-no-vocals|Reveilleawesome]] from [[album:cool-and-new-homestuck|CANH 1]], before finally settling on the idea of using Hello Zepp, and adding in relevant motifs to the Flash animation, in my normal song style. The whole Kermit the Frog thing is a reference to the Cheerfulbear Muppet Babies comics that, at least as far as I know, was the origin of the references to Saw seen in Homestuck. I feel like the song could have been better polished, but it's nice to finally have completed a song for this team and get to see it released

    <i>bobthetacocat:</i> (Artist)
    I originally claimed this track art even before [[album:cool-and-new-homestuck|CANHS1]] was released, knowing what i would do for the track art right then and there, which was to make a “conspiracy theory-esque” track art about how Hussie is actually Toby “[[artist:makin|Makingporing]]” Fox aka the one we know as [[artist:o|o]]. While it didn't turn out the way I expected, (I wanted to include a lot more reddit post theories, but there wasn't enough. Get cracking, theorists.) I'd say it turned out 'alright.' I wouldn't call it my best work, but it does the job. Not like anyone's going to look at the art anyway wonk

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Commentator)
    The track art doesn't have my ellipsis-based proof that Hussie isn't [[artist:o|o]] :jaedangery:

    I saw this rather emotional flash, and decided on the spot, right there: “This needs more fucking Nutshack in it”. And here we are. Also, a sneaky pun for the unexpecting youtube viewers who will get shocked by the music in this flash, thinking it's actually [S] Terezi: Remem8er, when it isn't. It's [S] Terezi: Re-meme-ber. Also, keeping up my tradition of ruining good songs with memes: this is the next in that sequence. Expect the worst from me in the future, cause that's what you're getting. Dirty-ass stinking meme dumps with little or no relevance, maybe. Except when they are relevant and are totally cool and new. Date of song creation: September 10th. This is an oldie. Also, this is the most emotional meme song you will have listened to in the last twenty minutes, maybe

    <i>ft-rj:</i> (Artist)
    And, I decided to make some fitting art to match. Memes are dead.

    At first I wanted to remix Creata for CANH to fix the problem that the beta kids' motifs didn't sync with the flash and because I'm the only one smart enough to realize that. But then I didn't want to because I thought it would be hard. Then I wanted to do it again, but I heard someone else already did it. I never found the old song so I went ahead and did it anyway. It turns out the old cool and new Creata was some kind of meme dump that wasn't meant to sync with the flash. 
    This is also my first song made in FL Studio which is a milestone because I was always the only person who didn't have it but now I do.

    <i>CreatorOfJanespeak:</i> (Artist)
    That rose edit is probably the best thing i'll ever accomplish. BUT HEY HIGH QUALITY FROGS AM I RIGHT. i really have nothing else to say about the art for this

    I have done my meme dump. I am now finally in the club. Also, in addition to finally memeing hard, I've gotten the chance to take the title for highest # of references. TBH, I'm not super happy with the track, but I learned about a lot of techniques and effects so that's pretty cool and new.

    I helped master this track to make it as loud as the others. I can use the amplify tool in Audacity!

    Funny story, I did this track art four times, first time with 49 references, later with 64, third time was 72 but i lost it, and the last time is there, you can watch it, well it was a pain to do, but it was worth to do it. If you don't like it i'll cry, so fucking much. :cry:

    <i>Makin:</i> (Wikier)
    Yes, even after finding a few unreported tracks and moving non-musical samples to their own section, it's STILL 72 referenced melodies. Un fucking believable.

    <i>Noisemaker:</i> (Composer)
    The one thing I tried to do with this track was to not use melodies from songs that had been used to death (I'm looking at you, Sburban Jungle). I then swiftly proceeded to use Showtime, Harlequin, and Doctor in the first section of the song. Still, I'm happy with how this turned out, and I'm glad I was able to use some obscure lietmotifs (namely Derse Dreamers and Hate You). One of the only problems that I had making this song was that I didn't use the original song's tempo, which led to a ton of spots that weren't synced with the animation. I was able to fix this by adding tempo changes, but I think it still sounds kind of chaotic at some parts. But other than that, I tried to make this one of the best songs I've done for CaNH, and I hope you can at least sorta agree with me.
    TL;DR: It's the Nutshack

Commentary: |- 
    <i>Wights End:</i> (Composer)
    The main reason I picked this track was because I borderline fetishize Tensei's music and I couldn't resist the opprotunity to deconstruct one of my favorite songs of his and rebuild it from the ground up. The initial idea of using Rolecoaster Tycoon's main theme is what spurring me into creating the song as a whole rather than just leaving it to be merely as aspiration. Converting all the referenced songs into a 3/4 time signature was a pretty difficult undertaking, but in retrospect I'm pretty impressed with how well I did it with some of the songs, particularly Conflict™® I wish I could say I'm completely content with it, but the unfortunate truth is that due to the constrains of the program I used when I made it, the electric guitars sound pretty crappy and also certain parts still feel rushed to me. I just hope that my final result is good enough to compare to the other tracks on this album.

    <i>Wights End:</i> (Artist)
    I decided to to claim the trackart for my own track because I didn't feel like there were many people that could make that would live up to my own expectations, so I figured I'd just do it myself. The original trackart of Heir of Grief is just a screencap from Collide, so I figured I'd do some cool and new flair to it. I wish I had taken the time to do something fully original, but other than that I'm pretty content with it.
