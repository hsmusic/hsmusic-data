    My first track for the prospit half of the album and probably one of my most notable songs on the album motif-wise. If it sound familiar, it's probably cause you heard it either at the end of Levc's [[Under the Sun]] or [[Antigone]]. For Grace's theme I wanted to convey both her importance to prospit as a member of the Kameron Family and the isolation that comes with that. For most of my music for the Prospit half, I took a lot of influences from JRPG soundtracks like final fantasy. This one was specifically inspired by [[track:aeriths-theme|Aerith's theme]] from FFVII and [the sacrifice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNfozTlye7w) from LISA the Painful. Not really much else to say about this one other than I want nothing more than Grace to be happy.

    Probably my favorite track that I did on the entire album. For this song I wanted to make a theme for the dynamic and bold socialite that is Lydia Kameron. As I mentioned on the commentary for [[Saving Grace]], all my prospect songs were inspired by JRPG sound tracks. This one was inspired by [[track:terras-theme|Terra's theme]] from Final Fantasy as well's as [Primrose's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErEGz0HHHOo) from Octopath Traveler. This is probably my favorite song composition wise cause it is so dense with harmony and counter melody. Eagle Eared listens might notice Saving Grace spiced through out the track but there might be something else in here as well. I wonder what it could be...

    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnK1i05UwyA), excerpt)

    So I wrote this song as a sort a more general theme for the Scholars of Skaia. I've personally found the gods in desynced to be the distinguishing factor between it and homestuck. In the desynced, the Scholars are far more realized as a concept than the Denizens, so they've had my attention for a while. For the song, I want to compose a piece that you would hear you were being told the lore about Skaia and her Scholars. [The latest update](https://mspfa.com/?s=28296&p=769) at time of writing (1/10/2021) would be a good example of a place you would here it. It took pretty major influence from the song [[track:lotus|"Lotus"]] by [[artist:seth-peelle|Beatfox]] both in terms of composition and instrumentation. The song also serves as a preview of something to come but I'll talk more about that when the time comes.

    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeLyyoIkL8U), excerpt)

    So back when I wrote [[track:do-you-dream-of-electric-sheep|"Do You Dream of Electric Sheep?"]] I had this idea for a track that was a combined all of the motifs for the Derse Dreamers in Desynced (I.E Evan, Josh, [Redacted]). Seeing as this was essentially our Prospit and Derse album, I figured it might fit nicely on Election Season. If it wasn't already obvious, this track is meant to be the Desynced equivalent of Solatrus's track [[track:derse-dreamers|"Derse Dreamers."]] The song follows as fairly similar compositional style, where I have an original melody serving as a base and then throwing in leitmotifs like nuts. Something that is unique to this track is how the song changes feels. The song goes between a more typical swing feel to some thing that more akin to a break beat. This was inspired by a song that we played for Jazz ensemble that went between latin and swing feels. Honestly this might be my second favorite track compositionally after [[Antigone]] and I'm happy with how this turned out.

    Gestalt is apparently one of the best songs I've written just based on the Music Team's reaction while I was writing it. The idea behind the track was simple enough, make a theme for Dusken that remixed [[Void of the Moon]]. Initially, I figured I would try and write a track that could fit the kinda jazzy feel we had already established for the derse side of the album. However, after a brief stint where I was listening to Apex Twin, I decided to try my hand at something in the vain IDM. What resulted was probably my best attempt at my breakbeat centric style to date. The whispers at the start and end where based on the concept of Dusken having clouds that whispers to people so I figured it might be appropriate to have em. Also yeah the woman laughing through out is supposed to be the narrator, who is pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Frankly, I don't know why people like this song as much as they do but hey I ain't complaining lol
