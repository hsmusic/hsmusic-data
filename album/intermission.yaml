    <i>Kalibration:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://screamcatcher.bandcamp.com/album/intermission))
    It's been ten years since we last performed for you.

    This is not yet the finale.

    This is only the intermission.

    the first Screamcatcher record in ten years to the day since [[album:bird|the last one]], something of a warmup on my way to give the project a proper "finale." Screamcatcher was my first real alias as a musician, back when I was just slapping together loops in FL Studio and handing out burned CD-Rs of absolutely embarrassing NI-Massive-preset brostep tunes at Chicago Peace Fest 2011. some things have changed a lot since then, some things barely changed at all, I fell out of love with "EDM" for a long while and got so self-conscious about being yet another wannabe "masked producer" that I downright regretted the entire affair. but after everything, it's still a part of me, and so here are five songs; Heretic, Meaningless, and Violence are brand new, while Frostbite and SWTD are from 2016 and 2017. all the new material was made in Bitwig Studio, the older songs were made in FL. i don't know when I am going to make any more tracker music worth sharing or more tutorials, besides this project i have been more focused on visual art, programming, and my life-ruining Dwarf Fortress addiction. hopefully this channel won't go completely dormant for another year, but don't hold your breath. thanks for listening, thanks for reading this, thanks for sticking around
