    this is actually a song for a little tumblr projected called tumblrstuck.

    i’ll be playing a roll in it later (beyond just making music for it of course :P)

    theme music for the land of curses and change.

    enjoy.

    yaaaaay now i get to post this. another song for tumblr stuck. its pretty much a pair to the other song i did ([[track:mind-your-step-young-squire|mind your step, young squire]]), this one being the battle or “strife” song.

    enjoy~

    yep. after… a week since the last one, its another MSPA esque song, and my longest one yet. someone said that it seems like something that would fit a current gamzee situation. maybe.

    anyway, enjoy.

    another MSPA inspired song

    due to the overwhelmingly positive response i got from [[track:grande-illusion|the first one]], i did another one, though i tried something a bit different to make it a little more me. anyway, enjoy~

    for maybe some context as to the idea/inspiration behind this one, i was dwelling on the thought of “well what are the kids going to do once they dawn on the fact that everything they knew before isn’t coming back?” of course this piece would be after any sort of post delusion drama.

    i’d forgotten i’d did this a while back and realized i never posted it.

    well anyway, its basically an overly dramatic version of [[track:grande-illusion|grand illusion]] done on a pipe organ.

    yep.
