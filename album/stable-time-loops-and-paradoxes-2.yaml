    This was my first song for the team. This is actually a recreation of an old piano melody I made a while back, so redoing the chords was pretty rad.

    <i>Rowyn Berlan:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)
    This song was basically made out of my love for the Alpha kids planets, this one in particular was supposed to be a kinda chill theme for the Land of Tombs and Krypton. The version you hear on the album took several hours as I was very critical and indecisive about what I was writing. In the end I'm proud of what's here but one day I'd like to [[track:|miasmic-resurrection|revisit the song]] and hopefully fix the parts I was super unsure about.

    <i>Michael Frank:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)
    This was initially going to be a recreation, utilizing the Secret of Mana soundfont used in the original song. I decided to try out some of the same instruments used in [[track:stronger-monsters]] (from [[album:undertale-soundtrack|Undertale]]) as well, which at that point I thought "what the heck, let's just make a full-on remix of this". Fun fact: I was initially following along [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|PotatoBoss]]' [Versus recreation video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYfZBrReslY), before I knew who he was.

Lyrics: |-
    ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO...
    roughly one million babies were born in the united states alone
    one of these babies
    looked like tensei from the homestuck music team
    this is the story about that
    his name
    <big><big><i>CHRIS</i></big></big>
Commentary: |-
    <i>Pascal van den Bos:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)
    I made this song as a birthday gift to [[artist:rowyn-berlan|TimelessHeir]], i wanted to kind of parody [[album:the-baby-is-you|"The Baby is You"]] since we had just finished ["The Baby is STLaP2"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqi0iMdsva_wMBDC1dZgYmg--sJgtXtmG) and it seemed funny to me to make that for them. The only song I referenced was [[track:miasmic-decay|"Miasmic Decay"]] because Timeless made it and that would make the song still fit in the album because it's still a remix of a song in the album. Also DVS-Saxophone is the best instrument, change my mind.

Commentary:
    <i>Caelan Kier:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)
    So this was made back when [[album:alternate-hues-and-melodies|AHaM]] was being made, pretty close to it being released the guy who was making the Sollux song didn't finish it for reasons I can't be bothered remembering, and since the position for the Sollux song was open I was like "damn I wanna do the Sollux song because Sollux is cool". So I made the first melody you hear in Distortion Navigator, but before I could do anymore we had to release the album like right then and there, so I didn't get to finish it. Then I just turned it int othe full Sollux song I wanted back then and released it here on STLaP 2 instead.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Beau Brian:</i>
    A requiem for those not lucky enough to surv<\i<\e Sburb. One cannot keep a gentle touch and sur<\i<\e. Rebirth, vvwithout elegance. They must steel themsel<\es, and knovv vvhat to do; vvhy to do it. True is resol<\e. After all, the game is young. R.E.T.R.Y. GAME.
    
    The length is actually a bit of an accident on my end. Sometimes there are just so many inter<\als and melodies that need their part, and each one of those need *some* kind of transition. Not sure if it shovvs or not, but this is certainly the track I vvorked hardest on, and ironically I made my longest track at a point vvhere vve had no more room on the album!

    <i>Caelan Kier:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)
    I remember like thinking that [my Mutiny remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3znbbnDOChY) could be totally better, so like I only made this a while after that was uploaded (that's why it sounds so much like my old stuff). I didn't even plan for the song to be said remix, I was just bored in FL Studio and placed down the [[track:mutiny]] melody in there and somehow just kept going until it turned into a full song. I was gonna put it in [[album:stable-time-loops-and-paradoxes|STLaP 1]], but then didn't because there was already a [[track:fetch-the-bullet|Mutiny remix]], so first chance I got I dunked it into STLaP 2.

    This song has a special place in my heart because it my first homestuck remix. I started this song months before I joined [[group:paradox-music-team|the PMT]] and I remember doing it out of boredom. I wanted to make remix a song the no one had done before, so I decided to remix the first half of the unreleased song [[track:jadesprite|"Jadesprite."]] The original demo of the song was like 30 seconds long and wasn't very good imo. Joining the team gave me the impetus I needed to expand upon my original demo and finish the song. Of my remixes, this one is probably my favorite.

    Honestly I don't have much to say about this, I don't remember starting this song, I guess I just put down some drums and then put down some synths and then put down some samples and then boom it's a song now.

    Wish Upon a Firefly was made right after [[artist:buzinkai|Usagi Buzinkai]] unfortunately passed away, i wanted to make a tribute song and there was no better track than [[track:doctor]]. I tried making it a more upbeat hero version of Doctor. In my opinion i could never get doctor right whenever i tried remixing it but this definitely worked out well.

    <i>Rainy:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)
    This song's commentary is going to get a little serious. After doing [[track:spritely-gardener]], I wanted to do another song for the album. I had a bunch of stuff started but I just never had the energy to finish them. One of the ideas was a massive multi movement homestuck medley referencing all the beta kids' land theme. But like the other WIPs, I couldn't bring myself to work on it more. This went on until some time in early November. In November, I learned that [[artist:buzinkai|Usagi Buzinkai]], Creator of homestuck songs like [[track:doctor|"Doctor"]] and [[track:endless-climb|"Endless Climb"]], had passed away. I was felt a profound sense of grief at her death. Some time passed, and I wanted to do something to commemorate her memory. So I decided to give my old project file another shot and that how "A Happy Ending" was created. I wanted to create something that embodied how much Homestuck and it's musicians meant to me. Is it perfect? No, it has a lot of issues and is overly long (Sorry [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|Pb]]). But I think it is something conveys the monumental impact that homestuck had on my life.

    So [[artist:rowyn-berlan|Rowyn(TimelessHeir)]] texts me at 1am asking me to [dub part of the first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk9MdEWLvHw) of [[artist:yu-gi-oh|Yu-Gi-Oh]] with them and [[artist:beau-brian|Beau(plasticSaturnia)]]. I of course say yes B) So we recorded it and i asked Rowyn if we needed a song for the background music, they said yes so i decided to remix [[track:passionate-duelists|Passionate Duelist]] from Yu-Gi-Oh. I tried to make it some sort of F-Zero GX style track.... So yeah a shitpost that's what this is.
    
    <i>Rowyn Berlan:</i> (album help, booklet commentary)
    
    This song is so emotional it had me on the floor in tears 10/10... anyway this is for some meme video I made which you can check out on the pmt youtube (4kids hates "creativity"). Caring, Compassion, and Kindness are the names of the legendary hero, Kia Subarus, blue eyes white dragons lmao (god this video is gonna be the reason I go to hell I swear)
