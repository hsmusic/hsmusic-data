Track: i think the fact that the team is dying is extremely scary. have a vaguely spooky sounding original song in the efforts to revive this mess of a team. boo. to be perfectly honest this album wouldn't have happened if there was less than 10 songs so i may aswell contribute somehow right because we need a december release desperately. woooOoOO.

Lyrics: |-
    I forgot the candy for Halloween,
    Reese's, Musketeers, Skittles'n'Snicks,
    And if my last record is any indication,
    This is the last treat before the tricks.

    I'm wide awake, it's cold and dark outside,
    These jack-'o-lantern lights have all burned low and died,
    I feel my mind at last begin to slip,
    like melting wax from a CaNdleWiCk.

Lyrics: |-
    Heirs and witches
    knights and seers,
    wouldn't you like to read something weird?
    come with us and we'll show you,
    this our comic cool and new

    this is cool and new, this is cool and new
    coasters roll on a theme park ride

    this is cool and new
    wild and wacky through and through
    build your park
    'til the imps are lined up out of sight
    Everything's gone askew,
    in our comic cool and new

    I am the cop with the hat and the gun,
    chasing down crimes and bad guys on the run

    I am the babe in the president's chair,
    and we are his guards in his lava-filled lair

    This is cool and new, this is cool and new

    cool and new, cool and new, cool and new, cool and new
    This comic, we live in,
    everything here has a different spin

    This comic, MSPA's new remix
    Looking forward to the next update

    The next page has buttons on the image and
    maybe they work is it interactive?

    NO! This is cool and new,
    none of us have got a clue

    you confused?

    Well that's just fine!
    read it once, read it twice,
    analyze the details thrice
    write a stupid post on the subreddit

    Everybody join, members of the crew,
    of our comic cool and new

    I am the dad with the tearaway face,
    fingers like hams and sanity misplaced,

    I am the

    I am the Spanish in the void of night,
    killing your ghosts with my majjyk might.

    This is cool and new, this is cool and new

    This is cool and new, this is cool and new,
    Cool and new! Cool and new! Cool and new! Cool and new!
    Cool and new, cool and new!

    Boggled readers watching agape,
    life's no fun without a good jape

    It's our job, but we're not cruel,
    in our comic cool and new

    This comic,
    irony all laid on thick
    everyone's waiting for that next update!
    Jhonny ebgret might find you on the net
    and creep like a stalker make you crawl out of your SKIN
    this is cool and new, everybody
    won't you please give room to a very awful guy?
    Our protagonist, top of every blacklist,
    everyone run from this psychopath

    This is cool and new, this is cool and new,
    Cool and new! Cool and new! Cool and new! Cool and new!

    This comic, we live in,
    every little detail with a different spin
