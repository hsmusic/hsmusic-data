Lyrics: |-
    (Ah, some good ol' high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off. OOF!)
    (This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like, AAAAAAAH [explosion noises] and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like [pancake-eating noises].)
    (That's a stupid animal. You're stupid!)
    (And as vice-chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. Look at my butt!)
    (Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!) (Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.) (Ah, futuristic!)
    (How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?)
    (I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.)
    (I won! I'm the greatest!)
    [Wheezing]
    (Uh oh.) [Exclamations of pain]
    (Whooooooooo!!)
    [Choking noises]
    [Exclamations of pain]
    (I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt!)
    (I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt!) (Eh, I've heard better.)
