Commentary: |-
    <i>SplitSuns:</i>
    ...When the hell did I get 100 followers?? I give my thanks to all of you for listening to my shitty music, haha.
    This is one of my tracks for the CaNMT's almost-vaporware all-vaporwave album, CANWAVE 3. In its current iteration it's a take on 2814's sample-free approach to the vapor aesthetic through ambient and techno albums such as 新しい日の誕生 and Rain Temple. It's one of my most complex songs yet and it took a lot of work to make, but the end result is something very awe-inspiring, even to me.
    (Originally this song was a straight-up cover of Voidlight that was much more laid-back and repetitive, but I scrapped it in favor of this version. Maybe I'll upload that old version somewhere along the line.)

Lyrics: |-
    (O child of noble family, listen without distraction. On the tenth day the blood drinking manifestation of the Ratna family, called Blessed Ratna-Heruka, will appear before you from the southern quarter of your brain)

    (His body is dark yellow in color, with three heads, six arms, and four legs spread wide apart; the right face is white, the left one red, and the center one blazing dark yellow; his six hands hold a jewel in the first on the right, a trident bearing three human heads in the middle, and a club in the last, a bell in the first on the left, a skull-cup in the middle, and a trident in the last)

    (His consort Padma Krodheshvari embraces his body, with her right hand clasped around his neck and her left hand holding a skull full of blood to his mouth)

    (Do not be afraid of him, do not be terrified, do not be bewildered, recognize him as the form of your own mind)
