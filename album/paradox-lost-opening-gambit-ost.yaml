    Your name is MSPAREADER, and you just woke up on an ALIEN PLANET. And not even the alien planet you're used to! Here on Alternian Colony 4.444 you'll find 12 new trolls to befriend, strange puzzles to solve, and a mystery to confront which will change your understanding of the mechanics by which SBURB generates new universes, and challenge the very concept of an Alpha Timeline.
