    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    The rock version of "Harlequin" sure made a scene, blasting through people's speakers as the background music for the Green Slime Ghost pogo game. Joseph nails the tough bits along with some sweet harmonics on the chorus.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Buzinkai:</i>
    I tried towill write something a little more thought provoking this time without too much drummage in the background. It came out smoothly, and I do think it's quite the haunting melody. I was unaware that Andrew wanted me to finish the original loop, and someone else remixed a longer ending for it, doing quite a fantastic job.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    "Explore" was one of Buzinkai's distinctive snippets that I arranged - the melodies he writes are always strong, and the only appropriate scale to work on with that kind of material is grand.
