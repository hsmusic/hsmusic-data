    <i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100615225737/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/))

    The second official Homestuck album, which includes the music of mid [[flash-act:a2|Act 2]] though early [[flash-act:a3|Act 3]].

    <i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20091217082112/http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/?game=autosave&s=6&p=002906))

    <b>Annnnd volumes 2 and 3 are up.</b>

    [[album:homestuck-vol-3|That was fast.]]

    Huge, ridiculous megaprops to [[artist:cindy-dominguez|Cindy]] for coordinating all this album stuff for me. It just wasn't happening otherwise. You might think we were dogging this release for a long time, but it really did take this long to get it all together, rounding up final mixes from [the crew](https://web.archive.org/web/20100113031120/http://mspaintadventures.com/soundcredits.html), reformatting chores and stuff.

    And a reminder: when you buy these songs the artists get the monies, so you're saying THANKS DUDES with your dollars.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    The rock version of "Harlequin" sure made a scene, blasting through people's speakers as the background music for the Green Slime Ghost pogo game. Joseph nails the tough bits along with some sweet harmonics on the chorus.

    <i>Buzinkai:</i>
    I tried towill write something a little more thought provoking this time without too much drummage in the background. It came out smoothly, and I do think it's quite the haunting melody. I was unaware that Andrew wanted me to finish the original loop, and someone else remixed a longer ending for it, doing quite a fantastic job.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    "Explore" was one of Buzinkai's distinctive snippets that I arranged - the melodies she writes are always strong, and the only appropriate scale to work on with that kind of material is grand.
