    <i>Morris:</i> (wiki editor)
    This is not an actually released album, rather a primitive type of <i>game "album" page</i>, something that might get implemented to the wiki proper in the future. These game pages will act like albums, but be for music contained within games, as opposed to a released soundtrack album.

    You might be wondering "<i>Where are the other 872 songs that are in the game?</i>". Due to the immense scope of the game's soundtrack, and the dubious relevancy of this game's inclusion on the wiki (ironically, [[track:megalovania-ssbu|the only relevant track]] is listed as the very last track), as well as the immense amount of work required to add <i><b>all</b></i> tracks to the wiki, only the songs that were produced <i>for</i> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate are included. This means that none of the songs taken directly from other games or works, as well as any of the original tracks and remixes from other Super Smash Bros. games are not included.

    The track listing is based on the in-game sound test, which sorts music into categories for each franchise. The track order here is also taken from the sound test, but with the aforementioned songs that are taken from other games taken out.

    Furthermore, there is one additional track that's not actually in the game itself: [[track:ssbu-main-theme-e3-version]]. This song has been available on [the website](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/sound/index.html) since E3 2018. It's mainly included here to simplify the references, as there is no actual "final" version of the main theme in the game, or elsewhere. Only arrangements (such as [[track:battlefield-ssbu]] and [[track:menu-ssbu]]). This is why the E3 version of the main theme is treated as <b>the</b> main theme.

    toridori no irotachi ga tsumugu honō no rasen (<i>Various colors weave into a spiral of flame</i>)
    hateshi naku tsudzuite ku haruka kara uketsuida hikari (<i>Continue endlessly, the distant, inherited light</i>)

Lyrics: |-
    Colors weave into a spire of flame
    Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
    Bear this torch against the cold of the night
    Search your soul and reawaken the undying light

    On that day, when the sky fell away
    Our world came to an end
    In our eyes did a fading sun rise
    In the dark, glimmering shadows

    Silence grows, in the spaces between
    Stretching far beyond time
    Rising up, as a chorus of souls finds a voice
    Flickering through the void

    These little sparks cling on to life
    Everyone caught in the struggle
    And then the storms of change, they fan the flames
    Scattering ashes to the wind

    Every soul contains a whisper of light
    Gleaming faintly as it dwindles from sight
    No escape, no greater fate to be made
    In the end, the chains of time will not break

    Colors weave into a spire of flame
    Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
    Bear this torch against the cold of the night
    Search your soul and reawaken the undying light

    As fate spins a thread without end
    New life draws its first breath
    Blossoming in a soil reclaimed from the past
    Where destiny holds fast

    Here where we stand, hand clenched in hand
    Everyone caught in the struggle
    This is the day we finally find our way
    Stepping into our tomorrow

    Every soul contains a whisper of light
    Growing louder as it calls to unite
    From the distance sings a chorus of souls
    Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals

    Colors weave into a spire of flame
    Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
    Bear this torch against the cold of the night
    Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight

    Every soul contains a whisper of light
    Growing louder as it calls to unite
    From the distance sings a chorus of souls
    Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals

    Colors weave into a spire of flame
    Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
    Bear this torch against the cold of the night
    Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight

Commentary: |-
    <i>Morris:</i> (wiki editor)
    This track is not in the game, however it has been added to simplify the references in the soundtrack. The "main theme" composition turned into the song we know as "[[track:lifelight]]", and the "Main Theme", the latter of which does not actually exist. There is no Main Theme, outside of variations (E3 2018 version, Piano Solo). [[track:battlefield-ssbu]], [[track:menu-ssbu]], and [[track:galeem-dharkon]] are the most explicitely arrangements of this theme. Hence, those songs will be listed as referencing this song. There is no "concrete" main theme in SSBU, no definitive song to be considered *the* Main Theme, only songs referencing the common/shared composition. [[track:lifelight]] is *not* the main theme, as "[[track:main-theme-ssbu-piano-solo]]" exists. As the E3 version is the most "complete" version we have, it will be treated as the common main theme for references.

    F-ZERO!

    F-ZERO!

    He steps right out on the dangerous track
    Stunning skyscrapers lining the perilous path
    Endless Horizon above the sea and deserts
    Silent, impressive, going fast as a valiant horse

    For the first to win the Queen’s Distress
    The silent city that fades away into darkness
    Certain to taste fevered kinetic energy
    Sonic booms rip through the rest of the scenery

    Flashing white! (Flashing white)
    Worlds asleep! (Worlds asleep)

    From the left to the right, let me first fighting you
    Who lets you do the fighting that we need to burst right through
    Go towards the promise to rock and roll!

    The king’s majesty broker in the silk city
    (in the silk city)
    Dwarf enemies, ride the wind with no pity
    (the wind with no pity)

    Once more the sea spreads itself before us
    Cowering the monsters, the heavens up above

    The rider up on the burning horizon
    (the burning horizon)
    The monsters of F-ZERO warp into real
    (into real)

    Fight to the ending, but don’t let up at speed of sound
    (the speed of sound)
    Pass the power, then grasp the power granted by the gods
    (granted by the gods)

    Faint lights pass through colored glass, in this beloved place
    Silver shines, the world dines, a smile on each face

    As joy surrounds, comfort abounds and I can feel I'm breaking free
    For just this moment lost in time, I am finally me

    Reach for my hand, I'll soar away
    Into the dawn, oh, I wish I could stay
    Here in cherished halls, in peaceful days
    I fear the edge of dawn knowing time betrays

Lyrics: |-
    Where have you been?
    Been searching all along
    Came facing twilight on and on
    Without a clue
    Without a sign
    Without grasping yet
    The real question to be asked
    Where have I been?

    I'm a shape shifter
    At Poe's masquerade
    Hiding both face and mind
    All free for you to draw
    I'm a shape shifter
    What else should I be?
    Please don't take off my mask
    Revealing dark

    Moments of calm
    Nothing left to be found
    A mirror right in front of me
    That's where I find
    An empty glass
    Reflecting the sad truth
    It's telling words not to be told
    I need the mask

    I'm a shape shifter
    At Poe's masquerade
    Hiding both face and mind
    All free for you to draw
    I'm a shape shifter
    Chained down to my core
    Please don't take off my mask
    My place to hide

    I can't tell you
    How to see me
    Just a cage of bones
    There's nothing inside
    Will it unleash me?
    Burning down the walls
    Is there a way
    For me to break?

    I'm a shape shifter
    At Poe's masquerade
    Hiding both face and mind
    All free for you to draw
    I'm a shape shifter
    Have no face to show
    Please don't take off my mask
    My disguise

    You better hide if you are bad, she’ll get you
    She’ll read your mind and find if you believe in right or wrong
