    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    an album of hecka and jefs 

    <i>Cecily Renns:</i> (Masterer)
    look, we all really like CANWC. its fun, clever, and awesome. there arent evidence to the contrary either. so an album celebrating the COOLEST and NEWEST character has been a long time coming
    i mean that quite literally; track 2, the Deep Lament, was considered for even vol 1; four or months so old. when Death of Swet Bro and you killed my bro came along, we thought of releasing the three has a three-movements-album
    for months, only an idea such as this remained. but the idea of "a hecka jef album" spread around, and more people made more songs. only a few, but we had to abandon the three-movements idea
    that'd have been cool and new, certainly
    but the 10 (reletively very short track number) songs were finished, and now, we present to you: the cool*est*, the new*est* album the cool and music team, no, the entire Homestuck fandom had the pleasures of listening
    s]hecka jef is now here, and we(well, me) are extremely proud of how cool and new it is.
    certainly, this is not good music. its not even a funny meme. it is simply: cool. and very, *very* new. this is no LOFAM or CAN Vol 7, but much more: what we represent as a team.
    one question remains. why are we so fucking awesome. and cool and new

    <i>Wheals:</i> (Storyteller)
    Hecka and Swet Bro are going to visit their friend Dabe when Bro is heartlessly murdered. After mourning his Loss, Hecka swears revenge, learning the perpetrator is none other than jhon. He hatches a plan to play Sburb without Bro, gains time powers, and gets time travelling items from his doomed alternate self. Finally, he confronts and kills jhon. At long last, he sits back and remembers the good old times, even though Swet Bro is gone forever.

    <i>Cecily Renns:</i> (Composer)
    Like one wise man once said: "i think i smoked a lot of crack and made this overnight"
    i really dont remember what my thought process behind this was though, i made it like, three four months ago, but bambosh did some very elegic vocals, which really completes this track to its fullest potential

    <i>miraculousAvantgarde:</i> (as Papa John's, Artist)
    don't have anything to say really, I just traced Hecka Jef onto The Thinker's pose and coloured it in poorly, and added some shitty effects onto Swet Bro dying, so there's that I guess
    'Write it in 200px comic sans please'

    <i>TirantBacon:</i> (Composer)
    So basically some time ago I heard about this album, and thought it would be a good idea to make a song for it. This is suppose to capture the rage, suspense and sadness of Swet Bro's death. Also Hecka Jeffery's sadness I guess. 
    Don't let the title fool you, it's not that grand. Although I have zero idea what your standards for good music are, so I'm going to assume you'll find it pleasantly enjoyable.
    this the snog whare swet bro says ;"you kiled swet bro prepair to die" i think...?

    <i>Shadok:</i> (Artist)
    ne day, me and my friends were taking a lot of stupid snaps, and then i said "i swear if we shoot something excellent, i'll make it into a canwc cover art". I'm still laughing at this cover (Fun fact: I was jhon)

    <i>Wheals:</i> (Composer)
    Like the album itself, the idea for this song dates all the way back to the early days of the team, when I was inspired by the pesterlog handle anonamousVengance to do some kind of remix of <a href="http://youtu.be/fq3abPnEEGE">http://youtu.be/fq3abPnEEGE</a> at first, I wanted to do an HQ rip of Savior of the Dreaming Dead (it's been long enough I don't remember why that song specifically), but when I realized I wasn't good enough to do that, I just did a normal remix.
    The drums not actually matching up was a happy accident due to FL screwing up. Makes the song cooler and newer, and I definitely totally didn't leave it like that due to already getting enough grief from it.

    tick tock is a really good song(s) so i made this; [[artist:makin]] and [[artist:cookiefonster|Cookie]] heard it and they thought it'd be great for CANH intermission 2, but i just did another thing with Negastrife because [[artist:makin]] told me to do that instead

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Composer)
    <span style="color: purple; font-family:courier, courier new;">One day I thought to myself, hey I should try making a completely original song. And then I said, hey I should make a theme for Hecka Jef. I combined these two ideas into this song, see for yourself if I did good.</span>
    <span style="color: purple; font-family:courier, courier new;">(I'm not sorry for typing like Rose even though I wasn't supposed to.)</span>

    <i>Wheals:</i> (Composer (but not of this song????))
    <span style="color: purple; font-weight: bold;">Would Rose say "I did good"</span>

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Composer)
    <span style="color: purple; font-family:courier, courier new;">yes she totally would</span>

    <i>StarlightCalliope:</i> (Artist)
    I took the spot to do this track art from Makin, since I really liked the Muse of Nanchos song, and wanted to do something for it. Also, because I wanted to draw Hecka Jef. (Was I supposed to type poorly for this?)

    “Man, what's the deal with stairs anyway?”p.s. ffs android your auto-correct sucks I'm just trying to make this purposely shittyp.p.s. william_ is a god for making this incredible art

    <i>william_:</i> (Artist)
    got the basis for the art from this promo poster (pls dont kinkysue me mr. seinfeld mcgee!): <a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/014/225/30188hiseinfeld1.jpg">http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/014/225/30188hiseinfeld1.jpg</a>
    a lot of work was actually spent getting the logo to look somewhat realistic. and yes that is a dorito in place of the dot on the 'i'. this art is rich in layered meaning!
    p.s. most of this art's philosophical impact can be attributed to kyle's megapack brushes for making my art not look shitty, or making it look kinda ironically shitty, idk it's just art who caaaaares
    p.p.s. thx noisemaker you're mad rad (⌐■_■)
