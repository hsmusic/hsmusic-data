    Homestuck remixes, lots of them.

    <i>Thomas Ibarra:</i> ([Bandcamp download blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409111336/http://sparksd2145.bandcamp.com/))

    Comes complete with a near-perfect rendering of the [[flash:fan-animation-homestuck|"Irradiated"]] animation (in celebration of nearly 100,000 hits as of this writing), and a printable booklet of all original track art!

    <i>Thomas Ibarra:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409111336/http://sparksd2145.bandcamp.com/))

    Gracious thanks to the talented individuals running MS Paint Adventures, their hard work inspired me to write these recomposed works.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    This album is a rather early fandom release. Its entry on the wiki is mostly modeled around [the SoundCloud album/set](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/sets/homestuck-mixes), which appears to be where these tracks were originally released. Shenanigans: MSPA was also released [on Bandcamp](tps://web.archive.org/web/20130409111336/http://sparksd2145.bandcamp.com/); this release is no longer directly available, but is rehosted [on skaia.net](http://dl.skaia.net/albums). (Albeit, missing the track art booklet and Irradiated animation rendering, which are currently lost media.)

    The track list on SoundCloud is the one reflected on the wiki; tracks are generally ordered (presumably by the composer) in a custom way, rather than chronologically. On Bandcamp tracks are alphabetical. The wiki also uses the "album release date" and per-track dates from SoundCloud. On Bandcamp the release date is [[date:September 22, 2012]]. (The SoundCloud set appears to have been created on [[date:August 12, 2011]], matching the upload date of the earliest few tracks.)

    The SoundCloud set has three tracks which weren't present on Bandcamp:

    - [[track:irradiated-animation-version]]
    - [[track:sweet-tart-theme-extended]]
    - [[track:adieu-shenanigans-mspa]]

    Bandcamp, likewise, had four exclusive tracks:

    - [[track:ace-of-spades]]
    - [[track:interlude-shenanigans-mspa]]
    - [[track:mjollnir-shenanigans-mspa]]
    - [[track:shatter-shenanigans-mspa]]

    Rectify, by AutoDevote. (now completed!)

    \- I had an idea after I watched [[flash:4109|[S] Cascade]], and though I know it would go against Jack's present nature, I really feel like if he had the motivation to redirect his bloodthirsty warpath in the name of helping the kids (due to some unprecedented character development) he might. That being said, I sat down and began thinking. I've noticed a majority of the entries I've seen so far are covers of present songs, and while I was trying to stray away from using melodies and motifs that were already in existence, I decided to try my hand at it.

    I present my track for Jack Noir, Rectify. This is my second entry for [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|the Homestuck Music Contest]], and I really like the way this one turned out. I've logged twelve hours and nine minutes on this track so far, and I intend to polish it up just a bit further before I submit it officially. :D

    Centered around Jade as she makes her way to the heart of the forge, this track portrays the ignition and thawing of the land surrounding the mythical device of creation. The world begins to thaw in the warmth of the forge, and its inhabitants spur to life.

    This is my first attempt at an entry for [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|the 2012 Homestuck Music Contest]].

    <i>Thomas Ibarra:</i> ([SoundCloud description](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/irradiated-updated), 6/20/2012)

    The original Irradiated remix, updated and given [[track:irradiated-lofam2|new life]] for [[album:lofam2|the homestuck fan music album 2]].

    <i>B. A. Baker:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/irradiated-updated), 6/23/2012)

    This was the first Homestuck fansong I ever found... literally one year ago, I discovered this song, loved it, and looked for more fanmusic until realizing how big the fanmusic community really was. Hearing this song again one year later is so cool.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    As the SoundCloud description and comment there indicate, this isn't the original version of Irradiated. It does appear to be the same version as included in [the Bandcamp release](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409111336/http://sparksd2145.bandcamp.com/) of Shenanigans: MSPA, with matching 2:16 duration and included in [the SoundCloud album/set](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/sets/homestuck-mixes).
