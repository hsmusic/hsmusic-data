    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    or "RotG" for short

    <i>Makin:</i> (team manager)
    The RotG joke is a relic of 2016. A fanmusic group named Team Virgo (known for [[album:beforus]] and [[album:ancestral]]) had been teasing an album for a long time, or at least it seemed like they were.
    RotG, the anticipated album, stood for Rubric of the Guardians, an album for Dad, Mom, Grandpa Harley, etc. The hype seemed to be building up to something big, but the album was delayed for so long that the CANMT decided to parody its hyped release by also teasing their own "RotG".
    In the end, I don't think anyone outside the CANMT actually got the joke. Many such cases. The Real RotG ended up coming out in 2019, taken over by [[group:unofficial-mspa-fans]], who also absorbed most of Team Virgo. You might know it as [[album:cosmic-caretakers]].

    CANMT truly were ahead of their time.

    Oh yeah, the album itself. It's all the tracks that were too offtopic or bad for the main albums. The only track purposefully made for it was [[track:lore]], which I'll discuss in its entry. The track art is a parody of [[artist:robert-j-lake]]'s [Stuckhome Syndrome](https://spellmynamewithabang.bandcamp.com/album/stuckhome-syndrome-part-one-v1-years-in-the-past). AND I have one last piece of trivia to share with you: we released four albums in one day, and [streamed them all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwYhJaWVePk&list=PLoOnh0MiKsmIaQrZpqd5t1G7xOWf7_-EF) over an excruciating eight hours. Go check it out if you want to see a hundred people suffer.

    Wait I didn't mention that there's a fanmade [Homestuck sound tes](https://sanctferum.tumblr.com/post/638058644066435072/homestuck-sound-test-12202020-edition)--

    A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, 2009, is this young man's birthday.
    Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life, it is only today he will be given a name.
    What will the name of this young man be?

Lyrics: |-
    I'm
    Thinking of a number
    Between my buttocks
    Do you know what it is?
    It's my credit score
    And it happens to be 720
    The higher the better
    I'm thinking of a number
    between 450 and 850
    You know what it is?
    It happens to be 720
    Which is my free credit score
    This number is between my buttocks
    This number I'm thinking is between 450 and 850
    The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money
    But the number is between my buttocks
    Do you know what number it is?
    It happens to be between 450 and 850
    And the number --- is betw--- tween my buttocks
    The number is 720
    But do you know what number I'm thinking of?
    I'm thinking of a number betw--
    -tween my buttocks
    It hap-- ppens to be between 450 and 80
    and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is
    Fortunately that number is 720
    which is a number-
    between-
    450 and 850
    This number between 450 and 850 happens to be between my buttocks

Lyrics: |-
    (Bowman: I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks.
    Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty.
    The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money.
    I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty.
    Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score.
    This number is between my buttocks.
    This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty.
    The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money.
    But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is?
    It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks.
    The number is seven hundred and twenty.
    But do you know what number I'm thinking of?
    I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks.)

    (SiIvaGunner: Thank you for showing me this. It is as bad as I had imagined)

    (SiIvaGunner: Let this be your last warning, Cool and New Music Team)
    (SiIvaGunner: Let's go, my friend, and hope they have learned their lesson about overdone memes)

Commentary: |-
    <i>Makin:</i> (team manager)
    This is the only track on the album that was made specifically for it.
    We had a Bowman's Credit Score problem. If you've listened to [[album:cool-and-new-volume-s-x]], you know that already.
    The track parodies the parody music team [SiIvagunner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ecwl3FTG66jIKA9JRDtmg)'s "lore", by having the man himself show up and kill Bowman in the middle of the laziest mashup yet. It represents the very real ban of credit score rips in the CANMT. After this album, you'll see them vanish (until he gets revived by Stutzman in BOWMANIA's [lore 2: the revengening](https://coolandnewwebcomic.bandcamp.com/track/lore-2-the-revengning) anyway, it's exactly like in Star Trek: The Search for Spock).
    [[artist:no-funny-name]] is dramatically revealed as the traitor, referencing his fake persona's lore (i.e. [[track:the-beginning-of-something]]).
    In a way, this was the true Revenge of the GiIvasunner-- [shots]

    [META] SuicidalSushi and mindbleach: Slow your roll
    self.homestuck submitted 1 year ago by wade5454

    You two like to post a bunch of things about Homestuck from tumblr and the like. While I personally don't enjoy the content, you aren't breaking any rules, so my qualms are irrelevant.
    That being said, I do feel like there's a bit of an issue when I check /r/homestuck and I'm met with pages of posts by mindbleach or SuicidalSushi, with occasional breaks to show a post by someone else. You guys are obviously new-ish to this subreddit, so I'll explain you a thing.
    /r/Homestuck has always operated with discussion posts, communitystuck, and other such self-posts.
    These are now being absolutely buried by the nigh hourly posted links to "neat homestuck comix and art"
    Clearly I'm in the minority here when I say this, judging from the upvotes you guys suck from lurkers.
    Though perhaps you will listen to an important figure here.
    (Note how I pretend that being important means I post comments here sometimes and more than 10 people know I exist.)
    I'm not asking you to stop, It's nice to have more posts, I just don't want it blotting out the discussion and more community-esque posts.
    Homestuck brought me to the sub, the community made me stay.
    This is true for many of us here, even if such a statement seems alien to veteran Redditors outside of /r/homestuck.

Lyrics: |-
    Slow your roll-slow your roll-slow your roll
    Slow your roll!

    (Slow your roll, slow your roll, slow your roll, slow your roll) (until track ends)

    You two like to post a bunch of things about Homestuck from tumblr and the like.
    While I personally don't enjoy the content, you aren't breaking any rules, so my qualms are irrelevant.
    That being said, I do feel like there's a bit of an issue when I check /r/homestuck and I'm met with pages of posts by mindbleach or SuicidalSushi, with occasional breaks to show a post by someone else.
    You guys are obviously new-ish to this subreddit, so I'll explain you a thing.
    /r/Homestuck has always operated with discussion posts, communitystuck, and other such self-posts.
    These are now being absolutely buried by the nigh hourly posted links to "neat homestuck comix and art"
    Clearly I'm in the minority here when I say this, judging from the upvotes you guys suck from lurkers.
    Though perhaps you will listen to an important figure here.
    (Note how I pretend that being important means I post comments here sometimes and more than 10 people know I exist.)
    I'm not asking you to stop, It's nice to have more posts, I just don't want it blotting out the discussion and more community-esque posts.
    Homestuck brought me to the sub, the community made me stay.
    This is true for many of us here, even if such a statement seems alien to veteran Redditors outside of /r/homestuck.

Lyrics: |-
    On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
    In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
    When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right
    The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight

    Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
    The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
    On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as they go
    In fire and pain, now once again we know

    So now we fly ever free
    We're free before the thunderstorm
    On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
    Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
    Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

    So far away we wait for the day
    For the lives all so wasted and gone
    We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
    Through the fire and the flames we carry on

    As the red day is dawning
    And the lightning cracks the sky
    They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
    With resentment to their eyes
    Running back through the mid-morning light
    There's a burning in my heart
    We're banished from a time in a fallen land
    To a life beyond the stars

    In your darkest dreams see to believe
    Our destiny this time
    And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

    And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
    All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
    Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
    Day after day this misery must go on

    So far away we wait for the day
    For the lives all so wasted and gone
    We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
    Through the fire and the flames we carry on

    Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
    We fought so hard now can we understand
    I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
    For freedom of every man

    So far away we wait for the day
    For the lives all so wasted and gone
    We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
    Through the fire and the flames we carry on

Lyrics: |-
    Oh Diet Dr Pepper is the flavor that I savor
    It's sweet and spicy, totally unique
    It makes me want to sing this song about my soft drink saviour
    That brings me joy when everything looks bleak

    Oh Diet Dr Pepper by the can or by the twenty
    I drink them morning, afternoon, and night

Lyrics: |-
    Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
    I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
    She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
    In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

    Well
    The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

    So much to do, so much to see
    So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
    You'll never know if you don't go (W-w-wacko)
    You'll never shine if you don't glow

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold

    It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
    You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
    But the meteor men beg to differ
    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

    The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
    The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
    My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
    That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    All that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaars...

    Somebody once asked, "Could I spare some change for gas?"
    "I need to get myself away from this place"
    I said, "Yep, what a concept"
    I could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change

    Well
    The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

    So much to do, so much to see
    So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
    You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
    You'll never shine if you don't glow

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold

    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold...

Lyrics: |-
    OK, it's Childish Gambino, home girl drop it like the NASDAQ
    Move white girls like there's coke up my ass crack
    Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
    I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA

    In Adidas with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
    My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
    This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
    My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over Es

    Hot like a parked car
    I sound weird like "nigga" with a hard "R"
    Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
    Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me

    Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
    Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
    I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
    Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham

    These rappers are afraid of him
    'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, Gir, Invader Zim
    Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
    Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery

    Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
    Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
    "You're my favorite rapper, now"
    Yeah, dude, I better be
    Or you can fuckin' kiss my ass, Human Centipede

    You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
    You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
    "Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?"
    I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

    It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
    I'm burnin' everything you motherfuckers talk about
    It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
    I'm burnin' everything you motherfuckers talk about

    You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
    Fuck that, got goons like an arch-villain
    I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
    So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di

    Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
    Told me I should just quit: "First of all, you talk white!
    Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
    Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect

    I put in work, ask Ludwig
    Put my soul on the track like shoes did
    Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
    Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape

    Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
    Shoutout to Gambino, girls, my dick is in the building
    I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me
    And I like black girls who nerdy, but when they dance they be sayin' "Owww"

    I'm sorry for who followed me
    Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
    Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
    So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me

    I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
    I'm screaming, "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
    This shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
    Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony

    These rappers don't know what to do
    'Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune
    And I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left
    I swear this summer will be summer camp, bitch!
