Lyrics: |-
    (Oh)

    The pulse came through tonight
    just like I said it would
    You know
    I'm dying for you

    Open up your arms
    I won't open up my heart
    Doing us this harm
    How it's tearing us apart

    Did you wanna be stardust?
    I guess I never asked
    That sort of thing is for the looking glass

    (Don't leave me here
    Don't end this dream
    Can't breathe, delete)

    Darling, darling, can't you calm down?
    I never wanted to run you around
    This is my analog manifest
    This is the place I found to rest
