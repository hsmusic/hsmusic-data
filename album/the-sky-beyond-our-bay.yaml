Lyrics: |-
    Life goes on, days fleet by
    Yeah, they’re gone, with no goodbye
    With every run that I survive
    I turn to the sun to know I’m alive

    Frame up every loss, a memento of how I fought
    Yesterday's a day I can cross off of the page

    So when I go out tomorrow, just for the day
    I'm gonna drown my sorrow, dance it away
    And if you decide to follow, tell me you'll stay
    Even if our sky begin to grey

    And everything turns forever, moves to the rhythm
    Of the heart, love is our axis and axiom
    Everything's now or never, this is our anthem
    Yeah you know, we'll love and love again

    The sparkle of the blue untouched by me and you
    We'll sail the skies and say we left all our battles behind
    Now the tears of yesterday a thousand miles away
    We'll sail the skies all day
    Never knowing which nameless sea we'll find

    Years ago
    (Gotta go, gotta be at the start line
    Gotta know, want the sea and the sunshine)
    I was lost
    (Make it so, sailing off at the shoreline
    Let it go when I know what is mine, oh)
    Did I know
    (Gotta go, gotta be at the start line
    Gotta know, want the sea and the sunshine)
    How much it cost
    (Make it so, sailing off at the shoreline
    Let it go when I know what is mine, oh)
    I shrug off the chains
    (Gotta go, gotta be at the start line
    Gotta know, want the sea and the sunshine)
    That guarded my heart
    (Make it so, sailing off at the shoreline
    Let it go when I know what is mine, oh)
    A new age begins
    (Gotta go, gotta be at the start line
    Gotta know, want the sea and the sunshine)
    It's time to restart
    (Make it so, sailing off at the shoreline
    Let it go when I know)

    So when I go out tomorrow, just for the day
    I'm gonna drown my sorrow, dance it away
    And if you decide to follow, tell me you'll stay
    Even if our sky begin to grey

    So won't you come out and join me, dance to the thunder
    Let the rain fall like we fell for each other
    I know it's temporary, but till it's over
    Promise that we'll go it hand in hand

    The sparkle of the blue untouched by me and you
    We'll sail the skies and say we left all our battles behind
    Now the tears of yesterday a thousand miles away
    We'll sail the skies all day
    Never knowing which nameless sea we'll find

    Every sea and sky and every song and sigh
    I write the names that I still recall tonight

Lyrics: |-
    Wade in the waves when the tide is low
    You hear them lapping at your door
    Here, it's deceptively clear but you don't know
    Just what you're lookin' for

    There's always more than what meets the eye
    So dive in deep beyond the shore
    And, let the sand keep you high and dry
    But watch out as breakers roar, yeah

    Things always lie closer than they appear
    There's grand secrets lost on ocean floors
    Beware every ripple, as they draw near
    The riptides of my shallow shores

    I stay low, though I'm sure we could go
    I'll wait for her call to know, mustn't pull her under
    No, always submerged in her glow
    She holds back, she's afraid of flying
    I change tack, guess it's worth trying
    Lightning crack, am I still denying
    My hull breakin' on her

    Hundreds of things you don't see
    Constellate as the history of me

    There's always more than what meets the eye
    So dive in deep beyond the shore
    and, let the sand keep you high and dry but
    watch out as breakers roar, yeah
    (Go with the flow)

    Things always lie closer than they appear
    There's grands secrets lost on ocean floors
    beware every ripple, as they draw near
    the riptides of my shallow shores

Track: Tell You My Story

Lyrics: |-
    I used to watch for passing ships
    As if I might see the same one twice
    And I waited with breath bated on my lips
    As if someday I might hear his voice

    All the seeking and the drawn out sighs
    Couldn't prepare me for that night
    When he said move on, he'd been ready to fly
    And like a star in the sky he was gone

    Someday maybe I'll tell you my story
    There's a whole library of regret for the things I'll never do
    Oh, I've tried to close that book of rue
    But if you're down to try, I'd reopen those pages with you

    There's a corner in my heart for plans we didn't start
    The time we spent apart didn't fade his words away
    And ever since that day, I've let his shadow stay
    A haunting in the places I don't look at anymore
    But when the sunset pours in I can't keep my eyes open
    It's like outside me, everything has moved forward
    While I'm rereading foreword, hopin'

    Whoa-o-o-oh
    Someday maybe I'll tell you my story
    There's a whole library of regret for the things I'll never do
    Oh, I've tried to close that book of rue
    But if you're down to try, I'd reopen those pages, yeah
    Someday maybe I'll let myself weigh heavy
    There's an inventory of the things from my past that stay with me
    Even if you don't know what to do, if you're still not afraid
    There's a world I would trade in for you

    Telling the truth is half the fight
    Bring every secret to the light
    Unfinished manuscripts with half written promises
    Every surrender and strife
    Every love lost in my life
    Fight my fear, lay it out
    Where would I be without you

    Tell me how to begin 'cause

    Someday baby I'll tell you my story
    There's a whole library of regret for the things I'll never do
    Oh, I've tried to close that book of rue
    But if you're down to try, I'd reopen those pages with you
    Someday baby I'll let myself weigh heavy
    There's an inventory of the things from my past that stay with me
    Even if you don't know what to do, if you're still not afraid
    There's a world I would trade in for you

Lyrics: |-
    We knew it wouldn't last
    Your eyes were hollow
    An omen of sorrow

    This is the bed we made
    A slow burn explosion
    A crash in slow motion

    And I took the pains, I drew my crosses
    I took my gains, I cut my losses
    I braced myself for when it hit
    I braced myself to let go

    I watched it fall, the sky and all
    I saw it coming but it just hit harder
    Burned my wings and broke my strings
    I fell and fell into the rolling thunder

    Let you make your play, I thought you'd say
    you want to stay despite it all
    but it went as written
    and all was blown away

    Weeks, a blur of fears
    I've lived a minute for years and years
    Climbing through the ruins
    I've wasted centuries rebuilding towers from my tears

    Tried to fit each piece into the other
    I broke myself to match another
    You fought for me, I fought for you
    But nothing seemed to stay

    I watched it fall, the sky and all
    I saw it coming but it just hit harder
    Burned my wings and broke my strings
    I fell and fell into the rolling thunder

    Let you make your play, I thought you'd say
    you want to stay despite it all
    but it went as written
    and all was blown away

    The first to leave, the last to let go
    The last to let go, the last to get better
    The last to grieve, the last to move on
    The last to move on, the last to remember
    The first to leave, the last to let go
    The last to let go, the last to get better
    The last to grieve, the last to move on
    The last to move on, the last to remember

    I watched it fall, the sky and all (The first to leave, the last to let go)
    I saw it coming but it just hit harder (The last to let go, the last to get better)
    Burned my wings and broke my strings (The last to grieve, the last to move on)
    I fell and fell into the rolling thunder (The last to move on, the last to remember)

    Gone, the city sights, the spurs and lights (The first to leave, the last to let go)
    It hit and hit again but harder (The last to let go, the last to get better)
    Burned my wings and broke my strings (The last to grieve, the last to move on)
    I fell and fell into the darkness under (The last to move on, the last to remember)

    Let you make your play, I thought you'd say (The first to leave, the last to let go)
    you want to stay despite it all (The last to let go, the last to get better)
    but it went as written (The last to grieve, the last to move on)
    (The last to move on)
    The last to get better

Lyrics: |-
    And it's always on these dusky days
    That all these years you were gone
    Still vanish in the rays
    And the sun can lie but the moon will show
    That after all this time I can't let go

    Someone tell me how to live this endless life
    When each flower I give is answered by a knife
    So the days go on and the world will turn
    And every season still finds new ways to burn

    And it's always on these dusky days
    That all these years you were gone
    Still vanish in the rays
    And the sun can lie but the moon will show
    That after all this time I can't let go

    Someone tell me how to live this endless life
    When each flower I give is answered by a knife
    So the days go on and the world will turn
    And every season still finds new ways to burn

    And it's always on these dusky days
    That all these years you were gone
    Still vanish in the rays
    And the sun can lie but the moon will show
    That after all this time I can't let go

Lyrics: |-
    Take my hand, we'll float away, in search of the sun
    And then they, on land, can't say a thing when we've run
    Fly, we'll see there's so much sky beyond our bay
    Keep your eye on me, and I'll show you the way

    I'm tired of moving nowhere
    They all say don't go there
    All my dreams are threadbare
    Head hung low
    But since the day I met you
    I just can't forget you
    Baby can I let you know

    I want to go see the world together, forever,
    Whatever the weather, we'll keep our course, so
    Rained upon, snow or sun, when we've begun
    We'll make a run for far-off places whose names we don't know
    Oh, won't you go, come along, my summer song, the wind is strong
    Can't go wrong, we're sailing on where they won't know we're
    Soaring high, sinking low, anywhere that you may go
    I'll come cause I love you so

    I'm tired of moving nowhere
    They all say don't go there
    All my dreams are threadbare
    Head hung low
    But since the day I met you
    I just can't forget you
    Baby can I let you know

    I want to go see the world together, forever,
    Whatever the weather, we'll keep our course so
    Rained upon, snow or sun, when we've begun
    We'll make a run for far-off places whose names we don't know
    Oh, won't you go, come along, my summer song, the wind is strong
    Won't be long, we're sailing on where they won't know we're
    Soaring high, sinking down, we'll make right what was wrong
    I can cause I love you so

    In places that we don't know

Lyrics: |-
    Kimi ga ano sora wo atashi ni okutta koto
    Itsumademo zenzen wasurenai yo
    Zensekai wa zutto henkashiteiru kedo
    Aozora ga eien no

    So I carried my heavy heart beyond the shore
    There I sank in the waves, just couldn't take anymore
    Then I heard you call out and your smile broke the clouds
    And I saw like I hadn't before

    Now from the day you turned to me
    And said the sky was mine to pursue
    I knew everything would be alright if I was with you
    Time will change the whole world anew
    Nothing will remain as we knew
    But our sky will forever be blue
