Track: Basement Window
Duration: 6:12

Lyrics:
    Spent the summer indoors<br>Waking in the nights<br>Hiding from the rain<br>And the city lights<br>And when the marionette<br>Fell from the roof of the sky<br>We fixed ears to his head<br>And gave him cause to lie
    Went down to the petrol station,<br>Bought a pack of chocolate biscuits<br>If there was a time for better decisions<br>I think I probably missed it<br>It was early morning now<br>I lay in bed<br>Wondering what I really knew about you<br>What I never did
    No train runs through here<br>I never knew you<br>Won't say your name<br>Won't recognise you<br>When I smile at strangers<br>I smile politely

Track: Under The Earth
Duration: 4:15

Lyrics:
    Bright-vowel open-mouth forced-smile lusting-doubt backless-dress distress-replies white-sheet on-camera sung-account;<br>Blinded-prophet scales-in-hand October-birth reveal-demand I must confess it’s no walk in the park to lead and tail the marching band!<br>To hand is a thin man with points to his teeth,<br>And he stamps his toothpick heels against the darkening beneath!<br>In ram-tam trials and old mout whisper-feel backdoor deals under Oxford brogue feet!
    If I could only fold my stomach into itself<br>Lie supine in bed for days until my skin becomes as malleable as putty and all unheavenly physicality departs from me<br>A big love wouldn’t fit a body like mine:<br>It must be a little love,<br>It shies away when the cars honk and hiss,<br>But adores the bells on the horse-tram.<br>Eight,<br>Nine,<br>Ten.

Track: Coruscate
Duration: 4:18
URLs: https://nasqueron.bandcamp.com/track/coruscate
Lyrics:
    Water, risen in the East,<br>Engine of affusion,<br>Congregating endlessly.<br>Dreamer, woken from your rest,<br>Furnishing your bedroom,<br>Candle-light and ankle rings.
    If god is in my head,<br>Where is god in my head?<br>If god is in my head,<br>Where is god in my head?
    Brother, I'm sorry that I failed,<br>Cause you would have done better,<br>Managed what I never could.<br>I wish, that I was born with Grace,<br>With god's Noor within me,<br>With fire burning in my blood.
    Surat-al-Kafirun,<br>Will you be my defense?<br>Surat-al-Kafirun,<br>Will you be my defense?

Track: My Folks
Duration: 3:23
URLs: https://nasqueron.bandcamp.com/track/my-folks
Lyrics:
    A spiral of locusts<br>Rising up out of the elevator shaft<br>Through the metal latticework
    There is no light in me<br>This is not a place where bright young hopefuls go to die<br>Father one day you and I will both find peace<br>In the milk-blind eyes of the music box gods.

Lyrics:
    The feet are down on the ground<br>The air is cold<br>The car is westward bound<br>The sun is setting pink and gold
    The notions set about<br>Like leaves in fall<br>Fixed stubborn and still<br>As cave paintings on the wall
    In my own time<br>In my own time<br>(Upon Cro-Patrick sang aloud)<br>In my own time,br>In my own time<br>(Float for a day above this world of sin)
    Dark was the night<br>Deep was the sound<br>Airlines trembled at the sight<br>Heirloom heads sat round
    Scratch on the advertising,<br>Pick a better place to die,<br>Spitting, fucking, rising,<br>Soaring, desecrating the sky
    Alabaster, ivory walls,<br>That could pass for the clouds,<br>Your social curtain calls,<br>When you walk through the streets in shrouds.
    In my own time<br>In my own time<br>(That muttered head to head)<br>In my own time<br>In my own time<br>(Your life can grow much sweeter if you will)
    Dark was the night<br>Deep was the sound<br>Airlines trembled at the sight<br>Heirloom heads sat round

Track: Arbroath
Duration: 4:41
URLs: https://nasqueron.bandcamp.com/track/arbroath
Lyrics:
    You'll sit preserved forever,<br>A study in perpetual youth;<br>What smoke signals against the dun-coloured sky<br>Profess that wisdom hides like pearls,<br>As though the trees protest or the earth asks why?
    Come and learn, you bureaucrats of pure angelic leagues!<br>Beyond your angel souls lies what no man ever conceives!<br>From the moment to the moment all our lives are made of dreams,<br>And only when we step back do our stories stitch together at the seams.
    Oh narcissistic impulse!<br>To seek self-realisation,<br>In what? In tied up lipids, peptides, twisting untwisting in wires, cables across floors that sometimes catch my stop-start steps.
    But when the outside world bends in<br>Reaching your bed like dark hands from the past<br>And steals-,br>And stole-<br>And will remove from sight<br>Scrawled in diaries, dreams and at last, at last?
    Know this, then:<br>These words mean nothing<br>Your death means nothing<br>Your grave is just an empty patch of grass

Track: Without Eyes
Duration: 6:08
URLs: https://nasqueron.bandcamp.com/track/without-eyes
Lyrics:
    My violet dress,<br>My fikr-e-farda,<br>I swear I'm trying.<br>Crude image of man,<br>Learns the finer art of dying.
    Spine, thigh and breast,Missive from above,<br>My face is painted.<br>Oh blood of my own,<br>Cast your judgement,<br>On a burnished throne.
    I am naked, tired out,<br>No strength left in my voice, to shout.<br>Yellow paper, scrawled advice,<br>I tried to be better, once or twice.

Track: Maine
Duration: 3:08
URLs: https://nasqueron.bandcamp.com/track/maine
Lyrics:
    When I stand under the sun I wear the crown of love,<br>But when the night is at its most quiet,<br>I can hear death, against my bedroom window,<br>Bathing my face in pale white light.
    Wealth for culture heroes!<br>Medals for the dead!<br>The young must learn respect,<br>And when to bow their heads!
    When I was younger I thought that the corporeal was a pyramid reaching up to god.<br>Burnished-steel-helmed and mire-shod<br>But there are faces in the floor which see the feet of man tread by,<br>Telegraphing all the being filling up and reaching out of me.
    Splitting off the layers of the skin I live in,<br>He was not a nice man!<br>I got drunk and went to bed instead.

Track Art: Ephemerald
Lyrics:
    [Contenders (doggedly to circle round our driftwood/bracken beds)]: What does it take to grind our legacies down into dust and blood,<br>[Sowing fields with royal slips (read seeds),]<br>And what does only fury (pink and wild) buy for her daughters<br>You and I: Our dowry from the clinic bought us gifts to build our own ideas, our legacies of dust and blood and tablets under reconstructed gaping eyes; what other lies to mother and to father?<br>[Kate Keller (pouring lemonade)]: Recall you're still our daughter<br>[Clouds form over all the central belts that live within us, train track vessels, dendrites roads, the rain that reaches you and that which never will]<br>[Will (also Will)]: Arcady you will find in hell of all the places where you lay your head<br>[Lips (so suited to your own, or brushed by fingers after after sex)]: We'll never see inside each other but I don't think that I mind, our retinas are mirror images despite our separate lives and sometimes that's enough<br>[Contentments set aside<br>When early evening comes to haunt you with its question]<br>[Early Evening]: How much longer can you run for?<br>[Bread Baskets]: And to whom will you be turning? What anaesthetist will dull your aching heart and lungs, your failures cutting deep into your palmar arch, Granadan arch-door memories, cruel treacheries you tell yourself cannot be helped - so tell me then what silence buys?<br>The marketplace (with knowing eyes): What first words will be heard at that last wondrous time?

Lyrics:
    I went down to the basement<br>To check up on the sour mash<br>I looked down to the nonreactive ceramic tub<br>It was bubbling.<br>I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down.<br>I saw the dust devils swarming around.<br>Incoming sun beams cut them apart.<br>And I watched a shadow pass across my heart.<br>You were upstairs in the kitchen with your head against the sink.<br>Trying to cool down.<br>Trying to cool down.
    I know you don't believe me but I could hear you breathing<br>I looked into the tub and there the mixture was seething<br>With new life.<br>New life all around.<br>I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down.<br>You were upstairs in the kitchen with your head against the sink.<br>Trying to cool down.<br>Trying to cool down.

Track: Song For King Arthur
Duration: 6:13
URLs: https://nasqueron.bandcamp.com/track/song-for-king-arthur
Lyrics:
    Evening came to Avalon, with a discontented sigh,<br>I stumbled over mud and loose rock, climbed up into the sky,<br>I stood beneath the ruined chapel, alone with the windswept stones,<br>The flat round table plateaus sprawling out, pock-marked with crag-toothed thrones.
    I heard the birds up above, and the dogs in the distance,<br>Saw the sunlight above, offering its last resistance.<br>The city lit up, in brilliant pink,<br>Watched the day lingering on the brink.
    Watched the moon rising up, out east over the North Sea,<br>Saw the lights over the Firth, islands in the bay and ships docked in the quay.<br>Followed the tourists down the rocky paths back home again<br>Saw your starry eyes peer from the heavens at the forests and the fens.

Track: Vernal Equinox
Duration: 5:04

Lyrics:
    This changing is too much<br>I look down when I lie<br>I shudder at your touch<br>I snivel when I cry<br>When will the bones migrate<br>I close my eyes and shrink<br>I lie in bed and wait<br>To live
    (When does it get better?)
