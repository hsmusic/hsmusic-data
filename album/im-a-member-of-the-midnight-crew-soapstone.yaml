    happy 4/13! homestuck is awesome. ive been a homestuck fan for like... nearly 8 years?? which is pretty crazy to think about! here's what i guess is a little tribute to it

    THE MIDNIGHT CREW RUSE WAS A
    DISTACTION

    this is my first time playing drums in a song, and i will be real with you, i had to do quite a bit of editing to them. but im pretty proud of how they turned out!

    on the topic of soapstone music, i will not promise soapstone album will be out this year, because i promised that in 2022, and 2021. but i will try my damng hardest. 2023 year of the soapstone

    <i>Soapstone:</i> (post-lofam 5a2)
    HEY! i updated this song and it's on the homestuck fan-music compilation [[album:lofam5a2|Land of Fans and Music 5 Act 2]] (along with another original soapstone tune!). i will probably keep the version here the same as it was when i released it but if you'd like to hear a better version along with 98 other awesome tracks by other artists then check this out: [unofficialmspafans.bandcamp.com/track/im-a-member-of-the-midnight-crew-special-soapstone-version](https://unofficialmspafans.bandcamp.com/track/im-a-member-of-the-midnight-crew-special-soapstone-version)

Lyrics: |-
    I hate a moral coward, one who lacks a manly spark
    I just detest a man afraid to go home in the dark
    I always spend my evenings where there's women, wine, and song
    But like a man, I always bring my little wife along!

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew!

    The fun it doesn't stop 'til 12 on happy old Broadway
    So what's the use of going home until the break of day?
    Now something confidential, whisper not above a breath
    I once went home at 2 AM, and scared my wife to death

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew!

    I never shall forget the night I made six robbers run
    Although I didn't have a knife, a blackjack, or a gun
    I proved myself a hero of a very high degree
    I ran for home and six of them were running after me

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew!
