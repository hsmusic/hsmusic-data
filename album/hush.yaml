Lyrics: |-
    The conclusion that this journey
    Has me hurdling toward
    Is terrifying

    The confusion that we're feeling
    When we're not feeling bored
    Is worse than dying

    If the river has a course
    It's been dammed, it's been dammed
    If the journey has an ending
    It's a sham, it's a sham
    I don't know a way out
    But you know what I have?
    I HAVE A PLAN

    The redundancy of dreaming
    When we're living awake
    Has got me crying

    The abundancy of scheming
    That we just throw away
    It ain't worth trying

    But the one that lingers on
    Carries through, carries through
    I can feel it on me tongue
    Where are you? Where are you?
    Well, this could be the one
    So I guess I always knew
    I HAVE A PLAN

    Reading the words behind my eyes
    Guided by promises, some future prize
    Giving control to what you hear
    Behind your ears, behind your ears

    The wind that has been whipping
    Has been changing the way
    The birds are flying

    The direction that we're taking
    We've been faking to the point
    Of just denying

    Well, we're early in the stream
    Let it flow, let it flow
    If you're clinging to a dream
    Let it go, let it go
    For the one that follows you
    You will know, you will know
    I HAVE A PLAN

Lyrics: |-
    The HUSH that FELL stopped them cold
    Upon these streets where dreams are sold
    Cheap cologne, cheaper thrills
    Served on ice, slightly chilled

    Strangers passing by
    Met each other's eyes
    Looks they thought they'd owned
    Made their secrets known
    To the HUSH
    The HUSH that FELL
    FELL on us
    The lies we tell
    To the HUSH
    The HUSH that blows
    On all of us
    The ones who know

    The HUSH that FELL shook the trees
    Old receipts blew in the breeze
    Paper nights, plastic days
    Earth stood still, red with haze

    Lovers lost their grasp
    Losers would not ask
    Nothing could be said
    All just hung their heads
    To the HUSH
    The HUSH that FELL
    FELL on us
    The lies we tell
    To the HUSH
    The HUSH that blows
    On all of us
    The ones who know

Lyrics: |-
    All I wanna do is synchronize with you, babe
    All I wanna do is synchronize with you
    All I wanna do is synchronize with you, babe
    All I wanna do is synchronize with you

    All I wanna do is synchronize
    See the look of terror in your eyes
    At the moment when you sympathize with me

    All we ever do is fantasize
    About the life that you've romanticized
    Well, the lonely nights are no surprise to me

    All I ever do is simulate with you, babe
    All I ever do is simulate with you
    All I ever do is simulate with you, babe
    All I ever do is simulate with you

    All I ever do is simulate
    All the moments that we could create
    When you're acting like you don't relate to me

    All I wanna do is stimulate
    All the feelings we could consummate
    If you'd let your heart negotiate with me

    All I wanna do
    All I wanna do
    All I wanna do

    All I wanna do
    All I wanna do
    All I wanna do

    All I wanna do is synchronize with you, babe
    All I wanna do is synchronize with you
    All I wanna do is synchronize with you, babe
    All I wanna do is synchronize with you
    Synchronize

    Synchronize
    Synchronize
    Synchronize
    Synchronize

    All I wanna do is synchronize
    See the look of terror in your eyes
    At the moment when you sympathize with me

    All we ever do is fantasize
    About the life that you've romanticized
    Well, the lonely nights are no surprise to me

    All I ever do is simulate
    All the moments that we could create

Lyrics: |-
    Just a word to the black-and-white
    Hungry for the latest fight
    When you draw lines in the sand
    Take a look at where you stand
    Tough talk (bad words)
    Rough talk (mad nerds)
    I'm not somebody's sheep to herd

    What we are is who we hate
    Who we castigate for all the rest of time
    Little children, it would kill them
    If they knew what we were doing to their minds
    What we're for is fighting wars
    Filled with anger we did not choose to receive
    Some will fight, some will fall
    How can anybody choose what they believe?

    Just a word to the loud as hell
    Are you buying what you sell?
    No one has to join your side
    The world is more than just your TRIBE
    No flags (no signs)
    No names (no lines)
    No nation lasts for all of time

    What we are is who we hate
    Who we castigate for all the rest of time
    Little children, it would kill them
    If they knew what we were doing to their minds
    What we're for is fighting wars
    Filled with anger we did not choose to receive
    Some will fight, some will fall
    How can anybody choose what they believe?

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (Bowmantown Discord, excerpt, 10/4/2017)

    I'm glad you guys see the value in the message stuff. I feel like outside of hip hop you don't see a lot of music with a message these days. A lot of very personal work, a lot of good grooves, but not a lot of musicians who feel like putting their worldview out there.

Lyrics: |-
    This is no debate
    This is no apology
    Things fall apart, you know
    We can't fool the energy

    Is it push or pull
    Or is it spaces in between?
    Everything must come and go
    With forces we can't see

    Nothing that we have we're keeping
    Every star is always creeping
    Pulled apart by cosmic forces
    Isotopes in long divorces
    This was always bound to happen
    You can go down crying or laughing
    At least you're not the only one

    Don't be insecure
    Something else has moved the stars
    Every light that's guiding us
    SHIFTS RED and gets far

    Someday we may know
    But then we might be dead by then
    What good is knowing, anyway?
    We can't get it back again

    Everything we have is borrowed
    Past and present and tomorrow
    All of what we are, we're losing
    Nothing much is ours for choosing
    Give back to what you're given
    And as long as you're still living
    You'll know you're not the only one

Lyrics: |-
    I'm feeling shaken by the changes at this stage
    Though I can't count to it, I know I have an age
    Don't make me think of it, I'm writing on my page
    Don't take my toys away or I'll go blind with RAGE
    Blind with RAGE

    I'll run my fingers 'round through any woman's hair
    I'll steal anything that I've been told to share
    I'll scream that word I know if I can't leave my chair
    I know just what I want and when it isn't there
    Isn't there

    Blind with RAGE now
    Rip my page now
    Lose composure
    Curse the air
    Blind with RAGE now
    Act your age now
    I'm exposed, yeah
    Blind with RAGE

    I am not listening to that speech you have rehearsed
    I have my own agenda to attend to first
    You're just another stranger I will soon disperse
    Please love me at my best, for you will know my worst
    Know my worst

Lyrics: |-
    Wide awake in the dead of night
    Hung up on a losing fight
    This debate has lost its sight
    No moves left, WRONG or RIGHT

    WRONG or RIGHT, what's said is said
    WRONG or RIGHT, my hands are red
    WRONG or RIGHT, I am not ashamed
    WRONG or RIGHT, to endure this game

    Why'd you got to be so cruel?
    I'm just trying to play it cool
    I feel like such a fool
    When you're looking through me

    Why'd you got to play so rough?
    Haven't I been hurt enough?
    You wouldn't act so tough
    When I'm looking through you

    Don't act like you're so surprised
    I'm not afraid to meet your eyes
    Don't tell me I'm too uptight
    I'll face you, WRONG or RIGHT

    WRONG or RIGHT, this is who I am
    WRONG or RIGHT, this is where we stand
    WRONG or RIGHT, you'll know my face
    WRONG or RIGHT, you'll learn your place
    WRONG or RIGHT, what's said is said
    WRONG or RIGHT, my hands are red
    WRONG or RIGHT, I am not ashamed
    WRONG or RIGHT, to endure this game

    Why'd you got to be so cruel?
    I'm just trying to play it cool
    I feel like such a fool
    When you're looking through me

    Why'd you got to play so rough?
    Haven't I been hurt enough?
    You wouldn't act so tough

Lyrics: |-
    Hear it now, what is spoken
    WORDS are hanging in the air
    Take control, feel what's happening
    Speak to only what is there

    I am changed in my purpose
    Set in motion, come unlocked
    I am found in this ocean
    Of vibrations, learned to TALK
    To the WORDS

    All my life, I've known the WORDS
    But never knew the way to really use them
    Speak to only what you've heard
    The WORDS are there, and you are passing through them

    Was this here? Was this always?
    I was certain, I was wrong
    Now so clear, definitions
    Plainly written all along

    Ebbs and flows so resounding
    Waves are pounding in my ears
    I can feel what you're proving
    I am moving, I can hear
    All the WORDS

    All my life, I've known the WORDS
    But never knew the way to really use them
    Speak to only what you've heard
    The WORDS are there, and you are passing through them

    Kid myself I had control
    But I was part of something whole
    Or broken, how I let it get away
    Talking like I'm in a mirror
    I would have to learn to hear
    Or nothing would be there for me to say
    What could I say? (TALK)
    What could I say? (TALK)
    What could I say? (TALK)
    What could I say?

    Say it now, there's your answer
    In the questions you have asked
    Listen close, know you're welcome
    Let these moments truly last
    This is more than an echo
    This is feeling, this is touch
    Use your voice, make it clear now.
    You are here, now fall into hush

Lyrics: |-
    Movement in the dark
    Stationary sky
    Shadows in the park
    Formless in the night
    Breathing in your ears
    Whispers in the brush
    Nothing there to hear
    You against the HUSH

    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH

    Further down the road
    Nameless as a babe
    Lost within the cold
    Aimless as a grave
    Ears could not relate
    Eyes would not adjust
    Creatures of the day
    All fell into HUSH

    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH
    Oooh, fall in the HUSH

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (Bowmantown Discord, excerpts, 10/9/2017)

    Still very proud of [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD5i7HfQYPc).

    Based on a lot of different visual art. I'd love to spend more time on video art.

    Some of the art I was studying at the time.

    <img src="media/misc/bowman-hush-study.jpg" width="225">

    I think I'm always trying to figure out what level I'm going for<br>
    Music and otherwise<br>
    Trying to find a balance between abstract stuff and really literal stuff

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    The visual piece Bowman was studying is an untitled work by Ed Moses, most likely from 1975-1977 (cross-referencing the description in his photo with [this print sale page](https://web.archive.org/web/20240427213204/https://www.printed-editions.com/artist/ed-moses/untitled-leslie-sacks-gallery-ifpda-1-27/) for a similar work).

Lyrics: |-
    CHAMELEON, I, masked, advance
    changing my shape at every chance
    Lost in the truth of who we were
    Once long ago

    Radiant skies turned to ash
    Turbulent highs burn and crash
    Living our lives on borrowed cash
    Once long ago

    This is this, the lips we kiss
    Are worn as red cocoons
    Hats and wigs and Meyers-Briggs
    Like phases of the moon

    There was a time, once I knew
    Sent from divine, I was new
    I put you on, you wore me too
    Once long ago

    Into the blue, out of sight
    What we perceive, wrong and right
    All fades together in the night
    Once long ago

    The costume rips. The skin unzips
    We leave behind the lie
    Let it be, what once was me
    CHAMELEON am I
