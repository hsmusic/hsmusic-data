    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    Preziden Obana's musical masterpiece, detailing his life and future in 17 tracks of pure democracy.

    <i>Makin:</i>
    This album was planned when we realized we had a few pretty long obana songs in [[album:9]], while the album was looking to be a second [[album:cool-and-new-volume-sx]] in sheer length. We quickly agreed to make an obana album to contain these masterpieces, and with time the album grew into more than a tiny afterthought. Let's enjoy the album and make LODAD great again!

    <i>ackro:</i> (Album Artist)
    this art was originally supposed to be the track art for econony in state of disrepair but we needed album art before the deadline and we didnt have any so we just used mine. also scaro is the one who did the cool dramatic lighting on the head so dont give me too much credit. i tried doing some lighting for it myself but ended up just saying fuck it and put a bunch of orange shit on there. anyway i hope you guys enjoy my contributions to the team! this is my first album here and the team is basically like hsd but if hsd only had people who were cool.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Wheals:</i> (Composer)
    The idea of the song was to create march music for Obana's reign, with the inspiration of course of Stars and Stripes Forever (because, while a fair bit of American music was being referenced on the album, it was mostly the same songs over and over). I'm not entirely happy with it in that sense, because it doesn't reach my original goal of making a song strongly reminiscent of Stars and Stripes Forever without directly referencing it, ala She's a Sp8der.

    <i>XenoZane:</i> (Artist)
    not to stroke his ego too much but doing a parody of the nevermind album art was makin's brilliant idea

    (I thought that was funny, Michelle)
Commentary: |-
    <i>Akalabeth:</i> (Composer)
    Baby Obana is a complicated character, who derserved a complicated and nuanced theme. I simply gave the people what they wanted and created possibly the greatest obana song meme possible. I transcribed the Kenyan National Anthem (Ee Mungu Nguvu Yetu) and slapped a Touhou toy piano on that lil' shit. The signature Homestuck motifs are only there to solidify the cool and new nature of Obana's character. Hopefully you will hear this song and believe in a future of change, hope, and memes.

    <i>Minish:</i> (Artist)
    i was gonna do a porky thing but it didnt make much sense so i did a doctor baby and put obana on it and i am awesoem. he has a gun im not sure anyone looking at it noticed, but he is holding a gun. dont ever say minish did not draw baby obama hlding a gun, because he did. he did do this and this album is the evidence you need to 100% confirm this. somebody once told me that i would never reach this point in my life but i did. this is very evident from the track art you can see there. if you actually took the time to read this on the stream i congratulate you. please say "minish is a very good content creator" in chat in my honour, thanks

    It's funny, I first saw the video this song is based on during the 9 stream. I've always been a Sonic fan, so doing a Sonic based song seemed like a no-brainer for me after I saw the video. 
    
    <i>PoisonedElite:</i> (Composer)
    "You mean, The Chaos Emeralds?" but yeah that post is pretty funny, applause to Difarem and FrostyMac to doing a lot of the beginning and getting me to do this.

    <i>Difarem:</i> (Composer)
    commentary? what commentar- oh. all i did was rewriting the first bars of the track with new instrumentation after i heard cookie complaining about the original.

    <i>tempest2k:</i> (Artist)
    I actually like the half pipe. It's overdone, sure, but it's better than Blue Speheres. Seriously, fuck Blue Spheres.

    okay so cookie(fonster) told me to write what i did for the track art before i even finished my part of the track art. i'll write what i did after, but i'm keeping this here

  (Open Fire)

  (Don't be fooled, he will be back eventually. We have much to do, my SECANT SOIVICE)

  (What will happen next? Will Jerry admit her feelings for Obana? Will Jhon finally be brought to justice? We may only find out in the next episode of SECANT SOIVICE)

Commentary: |-
    <i>PoisonedElite:</i> (Composer)
    I originally wanted to make a theme song for the nakkodiles with shades that act as Obana's Secret Service (which i thought it would be funny to call them Secant Soivice) but I decided to do a radio drama style thing for them instead and this is how it turned out. I hear NPR a lot when in the car so I decided to butcher it with bad compression and throw it in. Enjoy.

    this is kind of embarrasing i just quit in a massive meltdown after someone said the obalbum was a bad name but i still didn't do commentary for this one. the first version of this was an earthbound sounding one but it used hail to the chief like half the songs on here so i scrapped it and made something original. now im going back to being angry that obalbum isnt the official name. also be sure to put this song after my last one so the story behind obalbum is easy to follow. 

    <i>ackro:</i> (Artist)
    i kinda just made this one as like a miscellaneous meme art for the album and just threw it here cause it fit well enough. not really that much of an interesting story. sorry guys, looks like im failing as a canmt member.

    Possibly my first completely original track done after somewhat realizing how to harmonize things (i'm still unsure that my understanding of harmonization is as it must be......).
    One of my buddies says that this track suits post-finale Mordecai from Regular Show and I should've named it ""Repeat and Rewind"", so there's that.

    <i>Makin:</i> (Artist)
    Ironic, that I would parody an art NyashAlex himself made for this musical track. 1x SHOWDOWN COMBO is great and even thematically related to this album, I could not not do it.

    <i>AlphaShire:</i> (Composer)
    This song was originally supposed to be a remix of baby legend but then when I made the beginning it sounded sort of like street fighter music so I just added figher to the end of it and made it sound kind of like fighting music, I didn't have the much experience with making music when I made this so it just ended being motif vomit, some parts sounded liek they could be their own songs so I've started working on making them into songs, not much else to say except that I'm thankful cookiefonster made it sound good.

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (Arranger)
    Editing other people's Famitracker files is hell but I hope it was worth it.

    <i>Scarodactyl:</i> (Artist)
    I don't even know anymore

    <i>AlphaShire:</i> (Artist)
    I was just practicing drawing until I thought, hey I can use this for an Obana song, I used it for my own song as to not dissapoint anyone who worked hard on a song to be unhappy with the art, I finished it and was debating whether or not I should use it but people said to just do it so I did, later Scarodactyl added shaing and made it look badass which just turned this song into being some shit I pulled together and other people making it awesome.

    Cool and New Webcomic is cool and also it's new
    It's made by some shitposter named o
    M S P Fan Ventures is where you can find it all at
    There's another cool thing about it though

    A couple cool musicians made some cool music
    Some people heard it, said why can't I do this
    Thought some more, said no reason I can't
    A team where everyone has a chance

    Not too stuck on high quality
    But still lots of good work can't you see
    You'll never know if you don't try
    You'll make the redditstuck fans cry

    Well Hey, now, you're an Artist, make art for some songs
    Well Hey, now, you're a Composer, go make some songs
    Put some effort in it
    We can't just put out complete shit

    (go, go, go for the moon)
    (go, go, go for the moon)
    (go, go, go for the moon)
    (go, go, go for the moon)

    It's a cool team and we keep getting newer
    The rejected songs should go in a sewer
    But the managers surely know the best
    The worst of the worst can still get on the sound test

    The discord list is getting pretty full
    But still nobody on it is too full of bull
    Our fan base is huge how about yours?
    That's the way we like it and we'll never get bored.
    Well Hey, now, you're an Artist, make art for some songs
    Well Hey, now, you're a Composer, go make some songs
    Put some effort in it
    We can't just put out complete shit

    (go, go, go for the moon)
    (go, go, go for the moon)
    (go, go, go for the moon)
    (go, go, go for the moon)

    Well Hey, now, you're an Artist, make art for some songs
    Well Hey, now, you're a Composer, go make some songs
    Put some effort in it
    We can't just put out complete shit

    Somebody once asked me "Have you read Jojostuck?"
    I said I haven't but that's funny as fuck
    I was struck by a concept
    I could make a cool song out of that
    And suddenly I was on the team

    A couple cool musicians made some cool music
    Some people heard it, said why can't I do this
    Thought some more, said no reason I can't
    A team where everyone has a chance

    Not too stuck on high quality
    But still lots of good work can't you see
    You'll never know if you don't try
    You'll make the redditstuck fans cry

    Well Hey, now, you're an Artist, make art for some songs
    Well Hey, now, you're a Composer, go make some songs
    Put some effort in it
    We can't just put out complete shit

    Put some effort in it
    Don't want to repeat volume six

    Somebody once told me LODAD is gonna roll me
    I ain't the sharpest ham in the shelf
    He was looking kind of dumb with his finger and his thumb
    In the shape of an "L" on his forehead
