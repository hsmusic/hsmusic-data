Track: Irony As A Lifestyle
Duration: '02:48'
URLs:
- https://kalibration.bandcamp.com/track/irony-as-a-lifestyle
Lyrics: |-
    You're just a little piranha now
    But you wanna be a big shark
    You'll step on anybody's head
    If it means you can reach the stars

    That's how this works, right?
    If you get what you want, then you'll be alright
    And maybe someone has to get hurt
    But to you it's worth it

    All you people make me fucking sick
    You'll cannibalize anyone
    Just to protect the status quo

    Is there a single thing
    That you think can't
    Be bought or sold?

    You're just a little podcaster now
    But you'll go viral and be a star
    If you can find the bad in everything
    You'll go far

    Don't let anything
    Affect you
    Only cynicism can
    Protect you

Lyrics: |-
    Anthony Kiedis, you can fuck right off
    Mr. Bungle was always better, so just fuck off

    All the filthy rich kids get to buy their careers
    And use their empty hearts to poison our ears

    So Billy Corgan, you can fuck right off
    'Cause Pavement was always better, so just fuck off

    Oh, of course I'm bitter
    Of course I'm bitter
    Of course I'm bitter
    Of course I'm bitter

Lyrics: |-
    Don't do it with your mouth
    I wouldn't mind with your hand
    If you could squeeze me in between, well
    That would be so grand

    I don't need to be inside to get what I need
    I know it must sound so perverted
    But it's all that works for me

    So bounce up and down
    Shake around
    Wiggle, jiggle
    I wanna feel them on my body
    Your pillowy

Track: Traffic

Lyrics: |-
    If you're in such a hurry that you have to kill me
    I guess I understand
    You've got a big fancy sports car, it'd be
    A shame to not go fast

    I'd like
    To ride my bike
    Without fearing
    For my life

    But if you take too much Xanax and you run me over
    I guess I understand
    The street belongs to potholes and SUVs
    It wasn't built for man

    I'd like
    To take the bus
    But it doesn't run anymore
    'Cause you needed that tax cut

Lyrics: |-
    Can I take your order, sir? Should I grab your coat?
    I'm so fucking sorry about the avocado toast

    'Cause you deserve the world
    I shouldn't even get two cents
    I'll admit, I'm tired of this shtick
    I think it's time for you to get bent

    So all the happy yuppies
    In their big, warm homes
    We're gonna drag 'em out into the street
    By their throats

    And all you trust-fund crust-punks
    Don't you dare sing along
    We'll have you up against the wall
    Before the next song

    'Cause where were you when it got cold?
    You were gone when it got cold, yeah
    You went home when it got cold
    'Cause you can leave when it gets cold, yeah

Track: Dead Again
Duration: '01:19'

Lyrics: |-
    [Money-changer, numberfucker
    Why won't you just die, motherfucker?
    Payday lender, big spender
    I've got some poison I'm returning to the sender]

    Wave away the people starving
    'Cause it's their fault - they didn't have savings accounts
    Christ said 'love thy neighbor'
    But that was before we put the picket fence down

    We're all waiting, we're all waiting
    We're just waiting for you to
    Fucking die already

Lyrics: |-
    I always wonder if you knew those words would haunt me
    I always wonder, do I haunt you too?

    The salt on your skin
    Conducts electricity

    It's how you let those songs in.

Track: Medicine Seller (The Traveling Song)
Duration: '03:29'
URLs:
- https://kalibration.bandcamp.com/track/medicine-seller-the-traveling-song
Lyrics: |-
    In the back of a stranger's car
    Maryland's so near, and yet so far
    I wrote this song six years ago, but didn't know the words
    I'm still piecing it together from everything I've heard

    Let's walk around
    These empty fields
    Figure it out, then talk about
    Just what it is we feel

    'Cause this city's crumbling into dust, yeah
    'Cause they'd rather die with it than give it to us, yeah

    I am
    Not someone you know.
    So despite what you said about us
    I said "I really don't think so"
    Now I'll be on the road again
    In no time flat
    And I can promise you
    I won't look back

    So you like seeing people hurt
    I get it, someone hurt you first
    And I'm sorry, but
    if you let that part take you over
    Like I did
    I know that you will
    Become the worst

    Don't let the flowers of evil bloom
    Take this medicine
    And pull them by the roots
    I know they've germinated
    But they can still be terminated
    There is still
    A way out of this doom

    Home
    Is
    Not a place I know
    Wherever my head hits
    I rest
    And whenever I feel
    I go
    I won't be long
    Now
    So please
    I'm gonna ask you
    Not to follow me
