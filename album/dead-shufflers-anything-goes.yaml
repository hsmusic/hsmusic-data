Lyrics: |-
    Well they said you was high classed
    Well that was just a lie
    Yeah they said you was high class
    Well that was just a lie

    Yeah, you ain't ever CLASSED?
    Well that was just a lie
    Yeah they said you was high class
    Well that was just a lie

    Yeah you ain't ever caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine

    Well they said you're JUST A LIE
    Yeah they said you're JUST A LIE

Lyrics: |-
    Tin can, ocean man, laying out a game plan,
    Sharp-dressed fella with a mind like a bedpan,
    East of the moon and west of the sun,
    Ain't no one ever said crime can't be fun,
    You just gotta shuffle!
    Yeah, in the dead of night, you gotta shuffle!
    Woah-oh!

    Derse street, heartbeat, stay light on your feet,
    Keep a loaded tommy gun ready in the back seat,
    Grifting is my business and business is good,
    You know you wouldn't stop me even if you could,
    You wanna shuffle!
    Yeah, when the lights go out, you wanna shuffle!
    Woah-oh!

    There's a radio,
    Playing the same old songs,
    If you don't pay attention,
    Then you might think that nothing's wrong,
    But if you look up high, into the empty sky,
    Everything's the same in a way that don't seem right.

    Brass knuckles, each fist, rivals in a neat list,
    Open up the door, step out into the pale mist,
    Here comes the Kansas City Shuffle,
    Riding on his wing,
    I don't remember asking you a god damn thing.
    It's time to shuffle!
    Yeah, in the nameless dark,
    You better shuffle!
    Woah-oh!
    Hey!

Lyrics: |-
    Everything is scary
    It's easy to wind up attached
    But loving won't save you, baby
    Nothing does that but warm, soft cash

    Pitch love won't keep the lights on
    Scarlet's not a red carpet tour
    Pallid pink love won't buy you oysters
    And ashen is just such a chore!

    Everything is scary
    It's easy to wind up attached
    But loving won't save you, baby
    Nothing does that but warm, soft cash

    Love is a hole you're standing in, digging with a spade
    Artificial diamonds, paper hearts, you've got it made
    "Precious" as a three-leafed clover
    Hon, your fantasies over

    This world runs on money
    They all want to be the big cat
    But having a soulmate, honey?
    Won't make you happy, I can guarantee that!

    Everything is scary
    It's easy to wind up attached
    But loving won't save you, baby
    Nothing does that but warm, soft cash

    Oh-woah-oh, warm, soft cash

Lyrics: |-
    I was wondering if it all was alright
    Searching for signals after every fight
    She never told me what the hell I did wrong
    I went to ask, and when I looked she was gone

    Next time, I just can't be so nice
    If you're weak? You're out, I'm not thinking twice
    We're here again, once this fervor fades
    But not her
    She's not made for spades

    Once I pursued her, I thought it was a trick
    Then I filmed her confession and I knew that was it
    She couldn't handle whatever we were
    My soulmate is out there, but it sure isn't her

    Next time, I just can't be so nice
    If you're weak? You're out, I'm not thinking twice
    We're here again, once this fervor fades
    But not her
    She's not made for spades

    I was wondering if it all was alright
    Searching for signals after every fight
    She never told me what the hell I did wrong
    I went to ask, and when I looked she was gone

    Next time, I just can't be so nice
    If you're weak? You're out, I'm not thinking twice
    We're here again, once this fervor fades
    But not her
    She's not made for spades

    Next time, I just can't be so nice
    If you're weak? You're out, I'm not thinking twice
    We're here again, once this fervor fades
    But not her
    She's not made for spades
