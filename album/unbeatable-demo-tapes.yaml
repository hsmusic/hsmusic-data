    i don't know enough
    i don't know enough about what I should prob’ly do
    and i am not in love

    and don't you know you gotta take me over
    break my bones but i will be ok

    oo ooh
    oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo ooh

    it's amazing how you're so familiar
    even though i do not know your name

Lyrics: |-
    da da da da da da da da da
    da da da da da da da da da
    that's all i'm hearing
    when you are near me
    a sweet and lonely beating of the heart
    i'm bursting out like a fractured battery
    leaking out what's been stuck inside of me
    da da da da
    da da da
    the sound of it is killing me so slowly, so slowly,
    as i'm waiting, i'm waiting, i'm waiting, i'm waiting for you

    i try
    i sigh
    i lie
    why?

    where do stories go when forgotten?
    what do puzzles do when we solve them?
    da da da da
    da da da da
    on and on and on and on
    da da da da
    da da da da
    on and on and on and on
    i've been wondering
    if all the nothing
    i have can go somewhere new
    but for now i'll slowly just be waiting, and waiting,
    and waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting for you

    you
    say things
    that i’ve
    been trying to forget
    and i've
    been stuck
    on loop inside my head
    because
    of all
    the compliments i get
    from you
    always
    make me
    feel worse

    i've had enough
    i'm breaking out
    i'm waiting no more, no waiting

    i'm fighting a way
    out of the haze
    i'm waiting no more on you

    i'm so sick and tired of
    watching trains
    pass by the day
    so i am
    waiting no more, waiting no more on you

    you
    say things
    that i’ve
    been trying to forget
    and i've
    been stuck
    on loop inside my head
    because
    of all
    the compliments i get
    from you
    make me
    feel worse than when you try
    to push
    me closer to
    the edge
    so now
    i'm done
    with it

    no more waiting
    i'm done waiting

Lyrics: |-
    i wanna share what's in my heart
    but my emotions tear apart
    all the words, all the chords
    before they have a chance

    i try to write them in a book
    but all the effort that it took
    i'll rip the page
    and let the pieces slowly drift away

    i can't escape
    this feeling and
    the shadows that it casts from it's core

    i can't find
    a new light
    to guide me back from the dark

    every time i open up
    this book of mine
    i always find
    it's all lost, all gone
    no thanks to the endless loop of
    apathy, perpetually
    tearing up the pages of
    my feelings to nothing
    and i~~ can't make it stop

    a melody
    was effortlessly free
    but now i only see
    an empty diary

    throw the notebook to the ground
    to join the pages from it's bounds
    had enough
    this feeling stole the passion right out of me

    i lay my head into my hands
    i've given it all that I can
    how do i
    open up and let the words free

    oh i reach out
    to find a song
    to give it a meaning for myself

    and i'll take hold
    and i'll cling tight
    but it always slips away

    every time i open up
    this book of mine
    i always find
    it's all lost, all gone
    no thanks to the endless loop of
    apathy, perpetually
    tearing up the pages of
    my feelings to nothing
    and i~~ can't make it stop

    a melody
    was effortlessly free
    but now i only see
    an empty diary

Lyrics: |-
    you should be sitting up straight, but without stiffness
    and should feel comfortable
    don't ever let yourself become tense
    now let's type some more on the home row keys
    ready? (hoo) GO!

    here we here we here we go nah

    using proper rhythm
    wiggle your fingers and jam the keys
    a quick snap of the finger
    and with practice, that's all there is to it (all there is to it)

    are you relaxed?
    you should be, you know

    using proper rhythm
    wiggle your fingers and jam the keys
    a quick snap of the finger
    and with practice, that's all there is to it

Lyrics: |-
    has your voice been truly locked away?
    kept inside these worn out tapes we've made
    but maybe this is another dream i'll soon forget
    so i'll put it with the rest and wait for you instead

    i'll open my eyes to find it was just another lie
    and you'll be there, somewhere to give me your reply
    and i will

    press record just like before
    hear your voice forevermore
    save the waves that resonate
    from a worn out tape

    i will find you in time in my mind

Lyrics: |-
    i'm staring at a mirror of myself
    all i see is someone else
    call my name and ask for help (i feel fine)

    wondering why i can't recognize
    the look i see in my own eyes
    they tear up but i feel fine (i feel so fine)

    this can't be where i am
    i know we're not broken just yet

    so let's begin (to start again)
    i won’t let this be where we end
    i'll give you this to make our world brand new

    despite the dark out there, there's a light we share
    That cuts through all of the doubt we tell ourselves that we can't bear
    give your voice a shout, your soul wants to be loud
    don't be scared of drowning out the crowd and hearing your new sound

    every time i look back in the mirror
    missing pieces reappear
    the parts of me i couldn't hear (now i am fine)

    so lets pretend (until the end)
    that maybe we could win this
    nobody besides us can say that we're finished

    this is where we are now
    and we're not stopping here
    this prison's now a battleground
    and we'll show them what they fear

    despite the dark out there, there's a light we share
    That cuts through all of the doubt we tell ourselves that we can't bear
    give your voice a shout, your soul wants to be loud
    don't be scared of drowning out the crowd and hearing your new sound

    i can't wait to see where i am
    What we've done here has just begun

    i know you hear me over there
    i know you're not afraid, don't be scared
    staring at a mirror of myself

Lyrics: |-
    i still remember the summer breeze
    brushing the words we sang through maple leaves
    In a field of daffodils we found our song
    In that moment is where we belong

    how did we drift apart?
    when the flowers wilt
    so do our hearts?

    i try to reach out with this melody
    that echoes between you and me
    but it's silenced by the endless doubt
    lost to forever now

    materialize our time into a song
    to keep the memories close as time moves on

    but it's worn out
    (distorted) and decayed
    as our strings
    (they break and) separate

    all the flowers now are withered through
    but with time they'll bloom anew
    i'll find a voice i am so lost without
    and break from forever now

Lyrics: |-
    you got this look in your eye as you talk too much
    about yourself when i suddenly interrupt
    i say hey, uh, honey, now that's quite enough
    i like the way that you're lookin when the lights go up
    i don't mean to be rude but i assume that we're vibin
    and this ain't an environment for that to survive in
    so how about we change it for a night on the street
    maybe tell me when you're free and then hey, let's meet?
    okay?

    you and me both be
    takin it slowly
    but you're holdin me boldly
    like you're worried i'm cold
    see
    i'm a little bit scared for how little you've known me
    that you seem like you know me, but our feelings are growing
    the way you approached me the minute you told me the way that you felt
    was pretty consoling, and i'm embarrassed how much that i fell
    but hey, i like this way more than being alone
    so, check, please

    movin back to the ride then back to the room
    let's go on inside and make a cocoon
    let's be the kind of alive when you're doomed
    the way that they do when there's nothing to do

    besides wait for the pin drop
    and laugh til the world stop
    watch things in bed on a laptop just half watched,
    half lookin at you in a tank top
    while we just wait til it turns off
    since the power in the city block finally bid adeiu
    but we're happy since we fit each other like glue on a school box
    or a a moral in an aesop, that's how it is ever since
    you and me got me and you and i'm feelin like a fool
    for ever thinkin it too good to be true
    when you made my brain pop, and it gave me the following thought
    about how to live better than not
    cuz you should shoot the one shot that you got
    why wait around for forever when there's now to be kicked off?
