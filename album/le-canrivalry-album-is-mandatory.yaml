Lyrics: |-
    [Approximate lyrics]
    (Nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic, eh Luigi?)

    demo sonnanja dame (<i>But that's not good enough</i>)
    mou sonnanja hora (<i>Look, that's not it anymore</i>)
    kokoro wa shinka suru yo motto motto (<i>My heart will evolve more and more</i>) (Ghostbusters!)
    kotoba ni sureba kiechau kankei (<i>If put into words, the relationship disappears</i>)
    nara kotoba wo keseba iiyatte (<i>If so, I thought it'd be better to erase the words</i>)
    omotteta? osoreteta? (<i>Did you think? Were you scared?</i>) (Ghostbusters!)
    dakedo are! nanka chigau kamo (<i>But wait! It might be different</i>) 
    senri no michi mo ippo kara (<i>Even a thousand-mile journey starts with a single step</i>)
    ishi no youni katai sonna ishi de (<i>With a will as strong as a rock</i>) (Ghostbusters!)
    chiri mo tsumoreba yamato nadeshiko? (<i>If dust accumulates, will it become the ideal Japanese woman?</i>)
    [shi] nuki de, iya shinukide! (<i>Without the "death" part, no, on the verge of death!</i>)
    
    Oh Diet Dr Pepper is the flavor that I savor
    It's sweet and spicy, totally unique
    It makes me want to sing this song about my soft drink saviour
    That brings me joy when everything looks bleak
    [Dr. Pepper lyrics continue as September starts]
    Do you remember the
    21st night of September?
    Love was changing the minds of pretenders
    [September lyrics continue as Bonfire starts]
    OK, it's Childish Gambino, home girl drop it like the NASDAQ
    Move white girls like there's coke coke coke coke ass ass
    [Michael Bowman Remix, One Week play simultaneously]
    It's been one week since you looked at me / Bowman Bowman Bowman Bobobo— (Michael Bowman)
    Cocked your head to the side / Bowman Bowman Bowman Bobobo— (Michael Bowman)
    and said I'm angry 
    Five days since you laughed at me saying / Bowman Bowman Bowman Bobobo— (Michael Bowman)
    Get that together come back and see me
    Three days since the living room, / Bowman Bowman Bowman Bobobo— (Michael Bowman)
    I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
    Yesterday you'd forgiven me / Bowman Bowman Bowman Bobobo— (Michael Bowman)
    But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry
    [One Week continues with Respect Your Elders unintelligibly in the background]
    Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
    As I make you stop, think
    You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
    I summon fish to the dish,
    Although I like the Chalet Swiss
    I like the sushi
    Cause it's never touched a frying pan
    Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes
    Big like Leann Rimes
    Because I'm all about value
    Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
    You try to match wits
    You try to hold me but I bust through
    (Hahahahahahahahaha) 
    (This is a certified hood classic)
    Bustin'-bustin'-bustin'-bustin'-bustin'-bustin'-bustin' makes me feel good!
    [Hotline Bling by Kidz Bop plays unintelligibly in the background]
    I'm taking you to flavortown
    I'm taking ya, I'm taking ya to flavortown
    I'm taking you to flavortown
    (I'll get that ready for you)
    Vrei să pleci dar nu mă, nu mă iei (Ah, Gay Spaghetti Chef, you always come through for me)
    Nu mă, nu mă iei
    Nu mă, nu mă, nu mă iei
    Chipul tău şi
    Dragostea din tei
    Mi-amintesc de ochii tăi (This is just a plate of spaghetti)
    Chocolate Rain
    Some stay dry and others feel the pain
    Chocolate Rain
    A baby born will die before the sin
    Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha,
    Mai-ia
    Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha,
    Mai-ia ha ha
    (You know what you wanna do with that right? Put a bangin' donk on it.)
    DON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAAAY ([unintelligible] my testicles?)
    X gon' give it to ya (What?)
    Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya (Uh)
    Knock-knock, open up the door, it's real
    With the non-stop pop-pop from stainless steel
    (Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?)
    [X gon' give it to ya continues in background with Before My Body Is Dry]
    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    [All Star continues unintelligibly in background]
    Here's a little lesson in trickery
    This is going down in history
    If you wanna be a Villain Number One
    You have to chase a superhero on the run
    Ima ga shoubu yo! (<i>This is the decisive battle!</i>)
    Watashi wa dare desho? Shiritaku natta deshou? (<i>Who am I? You wanted to know, right?</i>)
    Naraba koi kamo (<i>If so, it might be love</i>)
    Watashi no naka ni wa himitsu ga aru to shite (<i>If there's a secret inside me</i>)
    Sore o kimi wa? (<i>What about you?</i>)
    [Spliced Trouble Busters' lyrics]
    (Good bye, good bye)
    (Good bye, good bye) (Dirty stinking bass, bass, bass, bass, bass)
    Todokete (<i>Ring out</i>)
    Setsunasa ni wa namae o tsukeyou ka "Snow halation"? (<i>Shall I name this heart-rending pain "Snow halation"?</i>)
    Omoi ga kasanaru made matezu ni (<i>I can't wait for our feelings to resonate</i>)
    Kuyashii kedo suki tte junjou (<i>It's frustrating, but it's a pure-hearted devotion called love</i>)
    This looks like a job for me
    So everybody just follow me
    'Cause we need a little controversy
    'Cause it feels so empty without me
    This looks like a job for me
    So everybody just follow me
    'Cause we need a little controversy
    'Cause it feels so empty without me
    Diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds (I think it's time to order a pep-pep-pep-pep)

    Najeneun ttasaroun inganjeogin yeoja (<i>A girl who is warm and humanly during the day</i>)
    Keopi hanjanui yeoyureul aneun, pumgyeok inneun yeoja (<i>A classy girl who know how to enjoy the freedom of a cup of coffee</i>)
    Bami omyeon simjangi tteugeowojineun yeoja (<i>A girl whose heart gets hotter when night comes</i>)
    Geureon banjeon inneun yeoja (<i>A girl with that kind of twist</i>)
    [Gangnam style plays with the lyrics to Goodbye To A World playing unintelligibly in the background]
    Naneun sanai (<i>I'm a guy</i>) (TA)
    Najeneun neomankeum ttasaroun geureon sanai (<i>A guy who is as warm as you during the day</i>) (KYON)
    Keopi sikgido jeone wonsyat ttaerineun sanai (<i>A guy who one-shots his coffee before it even cools down</i>) (TA)
    Bami omyeon simjangi teojyeo beorineun sanai (<i>A guy whose heart bursts when night comes</i>) (KYON)
    Geureon sanai (<iThat kind of guy></i>)
    [Gangnam style continues playing in the background with Takyon]
    (Hello Discord)
    (It's me)
    ([[artist:makin]])
    Triple six, five, forked tongue
    Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull
    How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
    TA-kyon

Lyrics: |-
    We play to win, just to find the dark
    Go home again, and we both fall out
    I wanna spend the time with you
    Doing nothing
    Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
    I hear the music in the background
    Singing, singing

    Oh, I haven't see the glory
    Coming, coming coming
    And we play
    We play, we play, we play like a..

    Just like a carnival
    Game (Just like a carnival)
    Laugh (Just like a carnival)
    Joke (Just like a..)
    Spinning me round and around and around
    Just like a carnival

    We play to win, just to find the dark
    Go... again, and we both fall out
    I wanna spend the time with you
    Doing nothing

    We... (Just like a carnival)
    We laughed (Just like a carnival)

Lyrics: |-
    I could never find the right way to tell you
    Have you noticed I've been gone?
    (Be)'cause I left behind the home that you made me
    But I will carry it along

    And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
    I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
    And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
    Until you're gone

    When I'm older, I'll be silent beside you
    I know words won't be enough
    And they won't need to know the names or our faces
    But they will carry on for us

    And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
    I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
    And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
    Until you're gone

    Oh, it's a long way forward, trust in me
    I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
    And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us

    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy

    X gon' give it to ya (What?)
    Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya (Uh)
    Knock-knock, open up the door, it's real
    With the non-stop pop-pop from stainless steel
    Go hard, gettin' busy with it (Ooh)
    But I got such a good heart that I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it (Yeah)
    Damn right, and I'll do it again (Yeah)
    'Cause I am light so I gots to win (Uh, uh, uh)
    
    Najeneun ttasaroun inganjeogin yeoja (<i>A girl who is warm and humanly during the day</i>)

    Bami omyeon simjangi tteugeowojineun yeoja (<i>A girl whose heart gets hotter when night comes</i>)
    Geureon banjeon inneun yeoja (<i>A girl with that kind of twist</i>)

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet (Let's do this!)
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    Yo I'm the GameGrl, and I've got the scores
    'Cause I woop butt and game hardcore
    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin
    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!

    It's the Nutshack! (Yo.) (Yee, yee.)
    It's the Nutshack! (What he say?) (Hooaugh!) (Hey...)
    It's the Nutshack! (Oh yeah!) (Ye-yeah!)
    It's the Nutshack! (Hey, I'm in that shit!)

    Now listen closely
    Here's a little lesson in trickery (You!)
    This is going down in history
    If you wanna be a villain number one (You!)
    You have to chase a superhero on the run

    Just follow my moves, and sneak around
    Be careful not to make a sound (You!)
    (Shh!)
    (No, don't touch that!)

    Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
    'Cause we need a little controversy
    'Cause it feels so empty without me

    I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
    'Cause we need a little controversy
    'Cause it feels so empty without me

    Soulja Boy off in this ho
    Watch me crank it, watch me roll
    Watch me crank that Soulja Boy, then Superman that ho
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    Now watch—

    Damn right, and I'll do it again (Yeah)
    'Cause I am light so I gots to win (Uh, uh, uh)
    Break bread with the enemy (What?)
    No matter how many cats I break bread with, I'll break who you sendin' me (Yeah)
    You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved (Uh)
    Bitch, and that's on a light day (Give up)
    I'm gettin' down (Down) like a nigga said "Freeze" (Uh)
    But won't be the one endin' up on his knees
    Bitch please, (Come on) if the only thing you cats did
    Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker

    (Good bye, good bye)
    (Good bye, good bye)

    Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
    'Cause we need a little controversy
    'Cause it feels so empty without me

    I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
    'Cause we need a little controversy
    'Cause it feels so empty without me

    OK, it's Childish Gambino, home girl drop it like the NASDAQ
    Move white girls like there's coke up my ass crack
    Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
    I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA

    In Adidas with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me (TA-KYON)
    My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery (TA-TA-KYON)
    This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef (TA)
    My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over Es

    Triple six, five, forked tongue
    Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull
    How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
    TA-TA-TA-KYON
