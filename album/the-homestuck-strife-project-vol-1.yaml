Lyrics: |-
    Don't panic  <!-- 0:23 -->
    Don't panic
    Don't panic
    Don't panic

    And you're calling me all manic  <!-- 1:14 -->
    As we're falling off the planet
    Calling me all manic
    As we're falling off the planet

    You'll find me running  <!-- 2:18 -->
    You'll find me running
    You'll find me running
    All the time

    You'll find me running  <!-- 2:44 -->
    You'll find me running
    You'll find me running
    All the time

    And you're calling me all manic  <!-- 3:32 -->
    As we're falling off the planet
    Calling me all manic
    As we're falling off the planet

    You'll find me running  <!-- 4:37 -->
    You'll find me running
    You'll find me running
    All the time

    You'll find me running  <!-- 5:02 -->
    You'll find me running
    You'll find me running
    All the time
