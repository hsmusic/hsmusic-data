    A simple brotherly rivalry strife. The singing of this song is simply a layer of irony that the simple-minded would not understand...

Lyrics: |-
    Let me get straight to the point, I'm terminating your capriciousness
    I've got plenty of truth bullets to end you with a vicious diss
    I'll overcome your Rage-fueled antics, 'cuz I know that I'm better
    Than this dumb and slow juggalo borderline sexual predator
    
    Hey motherfucker. I was gonna have a pie but
    I'd love to teach you not to mess with motherfuckin' highbloods
    HONK. This motherfucker thinks he slays. Okay, bro
    Leave you dazed for days, motherfuckin' flayed with Faygo

    You're a stoner joke, decaying all your lobes, and I my thought my brain was rotting
    Your plot armor can't save you here, this is your Final Dead Room
    So watch me make like Kanaya and split this jester in two

    Motherfuckin luck man, how does it work
    Do you get it from being a motherfuckin' one-armed jerk?
    I'm motherfuckin immaculate. Leave you needin' an ambulance
    You winning in this rap-off? Now that's motherfucking miraculous

    Thank god that awful Act's over, you're getting no applause here
    All your "sick fires" were faker than you being god tier!
    Your chucklevoodoo nonsense ends up as a slurred blur, so
    Someone should ring Aranea and silence you like Kurloz

    Your shenanigans are weak man, I motherfuckin' top em
    Seems this motherfucker's more suited to be "Ultimate Bottom"
    Leaving you subjugglated, ain't you a motherfuckin' sucker
    I didn't even need to sober up to beat you, motherfucker
