Lyrics: |-
    (Wait are you throwing that away?)
    (Yeah I wasn't that hungry?)
    (Can I have the rest of your sandwich? My mom forgot to pack me lunch.)
    (Um, no sorry.)

    (Hey, so I thought we were hanging out tomorrow.)
    (Yeah, my parents [unintelligible] sandwich and I just wondered if I could stay [unintelligible])
    (I don't think so, I'm sorry.)

    (What? You're leaving Pikachu?)
    (My mind's made up!)
    (Pikapi, Pikachu?)
    (I know you'll be happier here in the forest living with the other Pikachu. Bye, Pikachu.)

    NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (don't)
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

    (Mommy passed away this morning.)
    (Did she decide before if she would be a sandwich?)
    (She said no.)
    (That's pretty pretty selfish damn.)

    Round and round, let the city turn
    Party in the hills, we can party in the burbs
    Roof on fire, let it burn
    Champagne in my hand, I'm not concerned
    Next day fine, I'm try'na get live
    Yoga in the morning at Rodeo Drive
    Gotta look good when I hit the beach
    Wanna wanna Malibu, just can't speed

    Round and round, let the city turn
    Party in the hills, we can party in the burbs
    Roof on fire, let it burn
    Champagne in my hand, I'm not concerned
    Next day fine, I'm try'na get live
    Yoga in the morning at Rodeo Drive
    Gotta look good when I hit the beach

    Hey! Wait!

    Hey! Wait!
    Your advice
    Hey! Wait!
    I got a new complaint
    Hey! Wait!
    Your advice
    
    Chew your meat for you
    Pass it back and forth
    In a passionate kiss
    From my mouth to yours
    I like you

    With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
    You taught me everything without a poison apple

    You wear it well (TA-kyon)
    Mademoiselle
    Here's to your destiny
    Hysterics scream help (Kyon)
    Don't worry in a few you'll all be somewhere else
    Prepare yourselves (TA)
    Freelance motherfucker (Kyon)
    Get so fuckin dark in here
    Come come fuck apart in here

    Catch me by the Clair, I'll be right there
    Niggas copy everything we say
    Louie frames, eyes lower than my GPA (Uh!)
    ["Chip Da Ripper" continues playing in background] 

    OK, it's Childish Gambino, home girl drop it like the NASDAQ
    Move white girls like there's coke up my ass crack
    Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
    I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA
    ["Bonfire" continues playing in background] 

    So they're finally here, performing for you,
    If you know the words, you can join in too,
    Put your hands together, if you want to clap,
    As we take you through, this monkey rap!
    ["DK Rap" continues playing in background]

    ["Lose Yourself" starts playing but you can't really make it out at this point]

    (Trainscriber's note: you like Huey Lewis and the News? Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.)
