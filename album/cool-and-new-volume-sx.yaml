Lyrics: |-
    (Kevin: The concept of memes 
    was first proposed by Richard Dawkins 
    in a book called The Selfish Gene

    Blade Wolf: I am a slave to my memes

    Raiden: You're right
    About me I mean
    I knew something was off

    Raiden: I thought I could walk off the MEMES
    into a normal life
    but here I am
    surrounded by MEMES
    arguing philosophy with the US

    Blade wolf: Memes I encountered in the web
    had their effects as well
    as my mind grew, the weaker memes were sifted out, and the stronger ones endured
    the resulting collection of memes
    is what you would call
    my intelligence

    Kevin: If that meme isn't the cultural norm
    then what are you working for?

    Kevin: Genes, genes, genes, genes, genes and memes

    Kevin: Genes, memes
    Genes, memes
    Genes, memes
    Genes, memes
    Genes, memes
    Genes, memes
    Genes, memes
    Genes, memes, memes 
    [repeats throughout the rest of the track]

    Blade Wolf: Slave to my memes
    Raiden: Same as any of us
    Blade Wolf: Slave to my memes
    Raiden: Memes feel good
    Blade Wolf: Slave to my memes
    Raiden: They helped me forget
    Blade Wolf: Slave to my memes
    When I was deep in the MEMES
    Blade Wolf: Slave to my memes
    Kevin: Memes can also transmit
    Blade Wolf: Slave to my memes
    Kevin: From fashion 
    Blade Wolf: Slave to my memes
    Kevin: To core progressions in music
    
    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Monsoon: Magnetic force!
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Monsoon: Nature's force!

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Monsoon: Too fast for that
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Monsoon: Now there's a pretty meme

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Raiden: How about full of shit?
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Raiden: Is that a meme?

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Monsoon: That's game over
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Raiden: WHO DIES NEXT?

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Raiden: You buy a shirt you like
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Raiden: And put it on

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Raiden: People see you wearing it
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Raiden: Then buy it for themselves

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Monsoon: Red phosphorus!
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Monsoon: Infra-red is useless!

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Monsoon: All memes
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Monsoon: All passed along

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Monsoon: Does it hurt?
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Monsoon: The DNA of the soul

    Raiden: Envy, greed
    Monsoon: Free will is a myth
    Raiden: Despair, memes
    Monsoon: Religion is a joke

    Kevin: He went on to define memes as a different type of a self-replicating unit
    Even political expression, and just like normal genes, they replicate, they grow

    Kevin: But the way Dawkins put it? Memes can transmit worthless things
    Even the bad parts of a culture
    Fashion's one thing, but value-related memes can put huge restraints on people's lives
    For example, the idea that having lots of money is the ultimate goal, the thing we should all strive for
    You catch this money-worship meme, then not are you trying to get rich 
    You're also spreading that idea to other people
    You have to 
    And the really contagious memes can be even worse
    For example: revenge
    A guy sees his countrymen killed by terrorism, so he becomes a terrorist and retaliates 
    It's an infinite loop

    Raiden: There's gotta be a way to break the cycle though

    Kevin: Dawkins wrote about that too, how we can rebel against our GENES and MEMES
    Once you're aware of your own memes, you can train yourself to identify and replicate the "good" ones... 

    Raiden: And kill the bad ones

    Kevin: Right

    Senator Armstrong: If you're not with America
    You're against her
    Feel the wrath of the U S A!

    Senator Armstrong: Justice in the hands of the people
    Might makes right!

    Senator Armstrong: You know what? Fuck this

    Raiden: Your memes... end here!)

    I'm /u/Makinporing
    I created /r/homestuck
    I can't tell if this is a shitpost or not 
    Beware of the man who speaks in hands
    People don't want to think about Rose after the way her drunk arc was resolved
    (unintelligible) to the point where both of them were able to assign themselves one
    (unintelligible) Where is Terepy?
    Just me with certainty what happened
    Where are Jake's, Jane's character development, or anyone that isn't John or a Strider
    Last time I went to the /r/undertale Discord everyone was really mean to me
    There were a couple of awful mods, long sets of rules, the moment you stepped out of line, banned
    They probably want (unintelligible)
    I get what you mean now
    (unintelligible)
    (unintelligible)
    Someone should make a compelling
    (unintelligible)
    Some things aren't, I'm thinking if something accidentally gets black paint all over it is objectively ruined
    And similarly external, videogame-related circumstances can ruin a webcomic from the outside
    In a way that is obvious to most people once they notice
    Of course, people can like it despite that, but they'll know they like it despite the flaws, not continue thinking
    (unintelligible)

Lyrics: |-
    You're so hypnotizing
    Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
    Your touch, magnetizing
    Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
    They say, "Be afraid"
    You're not like the others, futuristic lover
    Different DNA
    They don't understand you

    You're from a whole 'nother world
    A different dimension
    You open my eyes
    And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

    Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
    Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
    Take me, ta-ta-take me
    Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
    Boy, you're an alien
    Your touch, so foreign
    It's supernatural
    Extraterrestrial

    You're so supersonic
    Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
    Your kiss is cosmic
    Every move is magic

    You're from a whole 'nother world
    A different dimension
    You open my eyes
    And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

    Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
    Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
    Take me, ta-ta-take me
    Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
    Boy, you're an alien
    Your touch, so foreign

    Wake up in the morning feelin' like P. Diddy (Hey. What up, girl?)
    Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)
    Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
    'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

    I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
    Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
    Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
    Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
    Pullin' up to the parties
    Tryna get a little bit tipsy

    Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
    Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
    Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
    Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh
    Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
    Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
    Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
    Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh

    Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
    Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
    And now the dudes are linin' up, 'cause they hear we got swagger
    But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

    I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk, crunk
    Boys tryna touch my junk, junk
    Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
    No-now we go until they kick us out, out or the police shut us down, down
    Police shut us down, down, po-po shut us down

    Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
    Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
    Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
    Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh
    Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
    Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
    Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
    Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh

    (DJ) You build me up, you break me down
    My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
    With my hands up, you got me now
    You got that sound, yeah, you got me
    (DJ) You build me up, you break me down
    My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
    With my hands up, put your hands up
    Put your hands up

    Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in

    Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
    Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
    Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
    Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh

Lyrics: |-
    On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
    In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
    When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right
    The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight

    Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
    The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
    On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as they go
    In fire and pain, now once again we know

    So now we fly ever free
    We're free before the thunderstorm
    On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
    Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
    Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

    So far away we wait for the day
    For the lives all so wasted and gone
    We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
    Through the fire and the flames we carry on

    As the red day is dawning
    And the lightning cracks the sky
    They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
    With resentment to their eyes
    Running back through the mid-morning light
    There's a burning in my heart
    We're banished from a time in a fallen land
    To a life beyond the stars

    In your darkest dreams see to believe
    Our destiny this time
    And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

    And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
    All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
    Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
    Day after day this misery must go on

    So far away we wait for the day
    For the lives all so wasted and gone
    We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
    Through the fire and the flames we carry on

    Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
    We fought so hard now can we understand
    I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
    For freedom of every man

    So far away we wait for the day
    For the lives all so wasted and gone
    We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
    Through the fire and the flames we carry on

Lyrics: |-
    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Well come on, get ready, get set, and here we go

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    You've gotta be ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing
    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe
    So, come on, and let's go!

    Alright!

    Hey!
    Hey!
    [We are number one, Hey!]
    We are number one, Hey!

    Now listen closely
    Here's a little lesson in trickery
    This is going down in history
    If you wanna be a villain number one
    You have to chase a superhero on the run

    Just follow my moves, and sneak around
    Be careful not to make a sound
    (Shh!)
    (No, don't touch that!)

    Now look at this net, that I just found
    When I say go, be ready to throw
    Go!
    Throw it at him, not me!
    Ugh, let's try something else

    Just sneak about, with graceful skill
    Now stay absolutely still!
    No!

    Babababababababa we are number one!
    We are number one! 
    Hey!
