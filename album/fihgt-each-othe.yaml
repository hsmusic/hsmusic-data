    <i>Kusoro:</i> (Composer)
    The story behind this song is that [[artist:pipko-fanfare]] posted a scribble of her playing the guitar and I thought "Hey, it'll probably be fun to try and rearrange it into an actual song. I'm pretty happy with the result, considering I've never tried to mix real guitar samples into my songs before that.

    <i>Kusoro:</i> (Composer)
    The first thing I composed in that track is the part that starts at 1:00. It was supposed to be a happy metal theme park song, but it kind of got darker as I kept adding new sections.

    <i>Lucas Adelman:</i> (Artist)
    This is the first thing that I’ve ever done for the CANMT. I’m not really that much of an artist, I just wanted to contribute something. It took me about an hour and a half to do it. I’m not really that good at commentary, I’m sure [[artist:kusoro]]’s is more interesting.

    <i>Kusoro:</i> (Composer)
    This is probably the only song I made for this album with strictly formulaic approach, thinking like “I want to do that and that for this particular section”.

    <i>ackro:</i> (Artist)
    I tried to do some cool perspective shit with this one. not sure if it worked all too well but i think it looks ok.

    <i>Kusoro:</i> (Composer)
    The only reason this song exists is that I found name pun somewhat funny.

    <i>Bambosh:</i> (Artist)
    Shortly before his retirement from professional wrestling, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson suffered a tragic accident involving alcohol, a branding iron, and a rock lobster. In one of the most impressive large-scale media coverups in human history, the World Wrestling Foundation was able to scour all traces of this injury from the annuls of history. Makeup and digital editing has masked his secret to this day, but know this: Upon the release of [[artist:kusoro]]’s solo album "FIGHT EACH OTHe" on the Cool and New Music Team Bandcamp, the truth was exposed to the world.
    What can I say except, "You’re welcome"?

    <i>ackro:</i> (Artist)
    I did what had to be done.

    <i>Kusoro:</i> (Composer)
    The wheel of fate is turning! I listened to Blazblue music and got some inspiration out of it. Also, the time signature is kind of wacky in that one.

    <i>Griever:</i> (Artist)
    I can’t draw Blazblue for shit. Also I was told to draw the Denizen Echidna, but who actually wants to see Rose fight a legit denizen? Nobody, that’s who. But now her denizen is rougher than the rest of them, the best of them, tougher than leather. You can call him Knuckles. Unlike Sonic he doesn’t chuckle. He’d rather flex his muscles.

    [[track:moshi-moshi]] contunues to be the best piece of music this team ever produced.

    <i>Frost Carter:</i> (Artist)
    I just kinda photoshopped this into existance. There happens to be a joke associated with this track that I could have very easily added to this art, but I decided not to. That would make it too obvious. :P

Lyrics: |-
    (Ole!)
Commentary: |-
    <i>Kusoro:</i> (Composer)
    This song actually started as a remake of [[track:one-and-a-half-midnight]], my [[album:lofam4|LoFaM4]] song, because it takes me about one month to become dissatisfied with whatever song I write. But then that OLEY sample fit well enough into the song for me to go “fuck it, it’s Lord Spanish song now”.

    <i>ackro:</i> (Artist)
    Oh wow, i made this one back when i first got on the team. which actually wasnt that long ago now that i think about it. feels longer. didnt really make it with any track in mind, at that point i was just making a bunch of drawings for the sake of it. the story behind its creation is that i wanted to go all the way with the lord spanish idea which led to a poncho, sombrero, and those pants with the buttons on them. im not even sure if 2/3 of those are even spanish and not mexican but whatever. i also called it the madrid poncho to be fitting with the theme cairo overcoat sets.

    You know how in some JRPGs, after the fight with the main villain, who actually did all the nasty shit throughout the game, you still need to fight some bullshit superboss who actually was THE ABSOLUTE EVIL all along?? If CaNWC was a JRPG and had one of those, this would be a song that plays during the fight.

    <i>Frost Carter:</i> (Artist)
    Now THIS was fun. I photoshopped all the character sprites onto a picture of some horrorterrors, jpeged the picture, and then repeatedly smooshed the picture, blew the result to full size, and repeated a few more times, until it looked the way it does now. I think I used a glitch-ifyer thing on the internet as well, but that hardly really added anything to the final art, so meh.
