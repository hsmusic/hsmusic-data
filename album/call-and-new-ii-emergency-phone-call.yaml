    CALL AND NEW II: EMERGENCY PHONE CALL is a linear branching (just kidding its not branching HA got you) album where the listener gets to not decide which remix to listen to next. This album is best experienced using Bandcamp and not its endcards because those dont exist on bandcamp dummy
    the premise is similar to call and new but round 1 only gave composers 5 minutes to make/remix a song, round 2 only gave composers 10 minutes to make/remix a song, and round 3 gave 20 minutes. the megamedley took 40 minutes (give or take an hour)
    we started this album literally 3 days ago

Lyrics: |-
    When you are old and grey and full of sleep
    And nodding by the fire, take down this book
    And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
    Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep

    How many loved your moments of glad grace
    And loved your beauty with love false or true
    But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you
    And loved the sorrows of your changing face

    And bending down beside the glowing bars
    Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
    And paced upon the mountains overhead
    And hid his face amid a crowd of stars
