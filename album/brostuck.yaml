    Uh!

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop

    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)
    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)
    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call
    (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)

    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)
    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)
    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then

    Well, then, you'll know just who to call
    (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)

    It's GameBro!

    Alright bros, are you ready?

    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?

    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games

    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame-

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop

    Alright!

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe

    Aw yeah! What's up gamers?
    I'm GameGrl, and I'm here to show you that girls can game too!
    Don't go easy on me, guys - unless you want to get beat by a GIRL
    Are you ready? Let's DO THIS!

    Yo I'm the GameGrl, and I've got the scores
    'Cause I woop butt and game hardcore
    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin

    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    When I'm on the scoreboard, you sure can tell!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    Cause I spell my scores "G-R-L!"
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    You gamer guys better take it like a man!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    If you can't keep up then talk to the hand!

    (She's a GameGrl) I'm the GameGrl!
    (She's a GameGrl) The best in the world!
    (She's a GameGrl) Girls rule!
    (She's a GameGrl) And boys drool!
    (She's a GameGrl) I'm kickin' rad!
    (She's a GameGrl) You're super bad!
    (She's a GameGrl) Better than the rest
    When you're gaming with the GameGrl you're gaming with the best!

    When I say "game", you say "girl!"
    GAME! GRL! GAME! GRL!
    When I say "best", you say "the world!"
    BEST IN! THE WORLD! BEST IN! THE WORLD!
    When I say girls, you say rule!
    GIRLS! RULE! GIRLS! RULE!
    When I say boys, you say drool!
    BOYS! DROOL! BOYS! DROOL!

    (Aw yeah. I'm having SO MUCH FUN. This is like a slumber party where there's nothing to do but play games ALL NIGHT LONG. Oh yeah, and NO BOYS ALLOWED. Not that I care - I can beat any boy at any game, any time, anywhere!)
    Puzzle games, fighting games, action, rpg

    Handheld, arcade, tabletopping oldschool
    Turn-based, card-based, tactical, strategy
    Text-based adventure, point-and-click mystery
    FPS, racers, platforms, rhythm games
    She's the bomb at anything you can name!

    Awesome! That was totally rad to the max! I could just keep doing this all day... NOT! I've got games to play, and if you think I'm gonna slow down just to talk to a bunch of amateurs, then you need to seriously blow the dust out of your cartridges.

    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    Gamer guys better run and hide!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    'Cause I'm the baddest, so step aside!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    I got the stats, and that's my proof!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    So come on and RAISE THE ROOF!
    (She's a GameGrl) I'm the GameGrl!

    So step into my GAMER GROOVE.

    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Well come on, get ready, get set, and here we go

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    On the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    You've gotta be ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing
    Where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    Ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing
    Where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    It's GameBro!

    GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe
    So, come on, and let's go!

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    Ugh!

    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro! (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!)
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    Are you sure you're ready for this? (The games will never stop, the games will never stop)

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you

    On the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    Ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing

    Aw yeah! What's up gamers?

    Yo I'm the GameGrl, and I've got the scores

    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin

    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!

Lyrics: |-
    Aw yeah! What's up gamers?
    I'm GameGrl, and I'm here to show you that girls can game too!
    Don't go easy on me, guys - unless you want to get beat by a GIRL
    Are you ready? Let's DO THIS!

    Yo I'm the GameGrl, and I've got the scores
    'Cause I woop butt and game hardcore
    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin

    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    When I'm on the scoreboard, you sure can tell!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    Cause I spell my scores "G-R-L!"
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    You gamer guys better take it like a man!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    If you can't keep up then talk to the hand!

    (She's a GameGrl) I'm the GameGrl!
    (She's a GameGrl) The best in the world!
    (She's a GameGrl) Girls rule!
    (She's a GameGrl) And boys drool!
    (She's a GameGrl) I'm kickin' rad!
    (She's a GameGrl) You're super bad!
    (She's a GameGrl) Better than the rest
    When you're gaming with the GameGrl you're gaming with the best!

    When I say "game", you say "girl!"
    GAME! GRL! GAME! GRL!
    When I say "best", you say "the world!"
    BEST IN! THE WORLD! BEST IN! THE WORLD!
    When I say girls, you say rule!
    GIRLS! RULE! GIRLS! RULE!
    When I say boys, you say drool!
    BOYS! DROOL! BOYS! DROOL!

    (Let's have a dance party RIGHT NOW. Everybody do the wave! Yeah, that's pretty good. Check it out! I'm dancing! I'm dancing! Check this move out! Oh man, oh yeah!)

    Yo I'm the GameGrl, and I've got the scores
    'Cause I woop butt and game hardcore
    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin

    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!

    (Awesome! That was totally rad to the max! I could just keep doing this all day... NOT! I've got games to play, and if you think I'm gonna slow down just to talk to a bunch of amateurs, then you need to seriously blow the dust out of your cartridges. But hey, girls, whenever you need to show those creepy boys who's boss, just remember that GameGrl's got your back. Look for me on specially-marked boxes of Betty Crocker brand snacks and have an adult call the toll-free number to subscribe to the exclusive girls-only GameGrl Magazine. Alright, check you later girlfriends!)

    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    Gamer guys better run and hide!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    'Cause I'm the baddest, so step aside!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    I got the stats, and that's my proof!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    So come on and RAISE THE ROOF!

    (Aw yeah. I'm having SO MUCH FUN. This is like a slumber party where there's nothing to do but play games ALL NIGHT LONG. Oh yeah, and NO BOYS ALLOWED. Not that I care - I can beat any boy at any game, any time, anywhere!)
    Puzzle games, fighting games, action, rpg
    Shoot 'em ups, beat 'em ups, virtual reality
    Dating sims, flight sims, CD-rom or console
    Handheld, arcade, tabletopping oldschool
    Turn-based, card-based, tactical, strategy
    Text-based adventure, point-and-click mystery
    FPS, racers, platforms, rhythm games
    She's the bomb at anything you can name!

    (She's a GameGrl) I'm the GameGrl!
    (She's a GameGrl) The best in the world!
    (She's a GameGrl) Girls rule!
    (She's a GameGrl) And boys drool!
    (She's a GameGrl) I'm kickin' rad!
    (She's a GameGrl) You're super bad!
    (She's a GameGrl) 'Cause I've got the moves
    So step into my GAMER GROOVE.

    (She's a GameGrl) Don't be a wimp!
    (She's a GameGrl) Unless you're a shrimp!
    (She's a GameGrl) I'm the new cool!
    (She's a GameGrl) You're old school!
    (She's a GameGrl) Gaming like a pro!
    (She's a GameGrl) Come on, let's go!
    (She's a GameGrl) Better than the rest
    When you're gaming with the GameGrl you're gaming with the best!

    She's a GameGrl

    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Well come on, get ready, get set, and here we go

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    You've gotta be on the spot, on the dot, we're just saying
    If you're too slow, thanks for playing
    You've gotta know where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe
    So, come on, and let's go!

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    Will never stop

    Aw yeah! What's up gamers?

    Don't go easy on me, guys - unless you want to get beat by a GIRL
    Are you ready? Let's DO THIS!

    Yo I'm the GameGrl, and I've got the scores
    'Cause I woop butt and game hardcore
    I might look cute but I play to win
    So get your head in the game, 'cause we're about to begin

    I got sweet moves and secret skills
    To pull off the codes, the combos, and kills
    Tapping my fingers like a maniac
    This girl's gone bad on a game attack!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    When I'm on the scoreboard, you sure can tell!
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!
    Cause I spell my scores "G-R-L!"
    GAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!

    Are you sure you're ready for this?

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games

    Ready to go, if you're too slow, thanks for playing (The games will never stop)
    Where it's at, who's at bat, and if you don't, then (The games will never stop)
    Well, then, you'll know just who to call

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe
    So, come on, and let's go!

    So, come on, and let's go!

    It's GameBro!
    When you're out of quarters, he's got your back
    He never ever betray you, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's your best friend, and never foe
    So, come on, and let's go! Go- go- go- go- g- go!

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    Will never stop

    Alright bros, are you ready?
    It's time for the one, the only, GameBro!
    He's coming to your screen straight from the magazine
    The mix meister of Master Swords and mushrooms
    Are you sure you're ready for this?
    Uh!

    The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite

    (It's GameBro!) The GameBro is here and he's got the games
    All you other lamebrainers better feel the shame
    He can bend the rules, he's too cool for school (The games will never stop)
    And he's got just a few cheat codes for you (The games will never stop)
    There ain't nothing that'll ever hold this bad boy down
    That hat that he's wearing's like his personal crown
    He's got every game beat and skills that sweet (The games will never stop)
    But if you want in his crew, you gotta be elite (The games will never stop)
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    It's GameBro!
    The games will never stop

    Uh!
