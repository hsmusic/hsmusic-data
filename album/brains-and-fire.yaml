    Time for a fiery bolero and some intellectual bytebeat. All the bytebeat songs have their respective functions written in their description; they may not sound great, but it's an experiment and it suits the theme.

    It's a bolero, because fire reminds me of boleros, probably due to OoT, but other than the fiery salsa or flamenco, the bolero just sounds more exciting.

    It's really similar to the left side, just one little difference. Also I'm cross dominant.

    ((t/4)&(t/2)%255)

    Most of these are just variations of one thing, I didn't write this down, but getting the numbers isn't too hard once you know what you're doing.

    This one loops really fast due to the left-shifting.
