    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    i'ts album fro cool and new web comic................................................agian!?!
    its the 2th one

    <i>Discfortune:</i>
    sometimes you need to sacrifice meme numbers for bigger and better things

    <i>ostrichlittledungeon:</i>
    Some of the stuff on this album is seriously some of the best music I've listened to, And I'm not talking about the shitpost tracks.

    <i>miraculousAvantgarde:</i>
    It was pretty hard sitting around doing nothing as the Art Manager. I had some coke (not the drink) and a can of pringles, but that still didn't satisfy my curiosity. Also, I'm currently eating a bowl of Fruity Pebbles. It's not great, but it's not terrible. I'd rate it somewhere [[track:bowmans-credit-score|between 4/50 and 8/50]]. Speaking of which, this message has been brought to you by Kellog's Fruity Pebbles. When you eat Kellog's Fruity Pebbles every morning, you'll feel like you want to [[track:fruity-pebbles-jingle|start a bloody war and build a pebble nation]]!

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    I'm just pointing out that this whole 50+ track album came out two and a half weeks after [[album:cool-and-new-voulem1|our previous 50+ track album]].

Lyrics: |-
    (Hello. I would like to explain just a little about my wife and me and our odyssey of faith.)
    (Alright. Alright. Alright. This evening as we continue to discuss Catholicism, Catholicism, Catholicism.)

    (Uh there's— there's a few different things we're going to look at and— that is not a misprint uh this, this is a different fill-in from, uh, the last one that kind of looked like this it's— it's just uh just modified there's more information, new information. Y'know before we go into this in terms of talking about Catholicism, lemme just give you guys just a little update about how everything went on Sunday. As we had our church launch for FloodGate East over at Madison Heights and uh, we gathered there at 6 o'clock and and, yeah. There's a balcony. There's a balcony. There's a balcony. There's a balcony.)

    (There's a balcony. There's a balcony. And, it was jammed. There... we could have squeezed a few more people in. There's a balcony. There's a balcony. I-it was is-is-isn't that right?) (Yeah.) (It was pretty packed, wasn't it? Lot of sweaty bodies dancing and moving and grooving. Oh, so— it is a good thing there was a balcony or we would have been turning people away. You know how we keep parking on the lawn out here and, we ru— the lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lot of sweaty bodies dancing and moving and grooving. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here and, we ru— we ran out of parking space here. We ran out of parking space there, every single parking spot was taken, people were parking on the lawn. It's— [laughter]. It's— [laughter]. It's— [laughter].) (It's time to move.) (It's already time to move! [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] There's the balcony. [laughter] There's the balcony. Yeah [laughter].) (Maybe we need to open a new church.) ([laughter] Yeah. I-it was uh, it-it was really crazy and, and, y'know ju— the anointing was powerful. Y'know the, the aspect of the people and all that, the amount of people that showed up was really cool, but the anointing was just off the chart. I-it was so good, uh, for an inaugural... opening night, uhm, just it wa-it was powerful, I don't know what else to say. The anointing was sweet and thick and uhm, [laughter]. There's the balcony. [laughter] Fun. It wa-it— and people were asking "Is this how FloodGate is normally?" and uh, and, and, people were, the people who were there from here— so we had about twenty people from here show up. Wou-wou-would you say that about twenty people? Maybe twenty-five? Yeah. But i-but there I m-there was— there was decent repre— representation. Lot of sweaty bodies dancing and moving and grooving.)

    (There's a balcony. Alright let's talk about Catholicism. There- there's so much about the Catholic Church that is, really is fascinating. The-it's a-it's a, interesting thing to study. They reach, they teach many orthodox things and then they teach so many non-orthodox doctrine. The relevant problem relates to— the relevant problem relates to forward. Now [clears throat] [clears throat] [clears throat] [coughs]. Within... the Catholic Church, there are multiple things that shape who they are, what they are, how they— [clears throat] [coughs]. Following the Pope, and— and by the way, the, the, uh, the top offices minus the priests are all considered bishops. Underneath him— lot of sweaty bodies dancing and moving and grooving. Underneath him would come the council of lot of sweaty bodies uh, not retracting. Most of us are like that, we're competitive, we like to do well, and, in terms of the- the priesthood, y'know-there-there are numerous things [clears throat]. Help us to be administrators of truth and help us to help people come out of darkness. We bless you and we thank you my God for your goodness and your grace and your mercy in Jesus name, amen.)

    City's breaking down on a camel's back
    They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
    So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
    You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
    You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
    A melancholy town where we never smile
    And all I wanna hear is the message beep
    My dreams, they got a kissing
    'Cause I don't get sleep, no

    Hazmats, fast cats
    Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
    Play these ponies at the track
    It's my chocolate attack

    Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
    Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
    Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
    With yo' sound, you in the blink
    Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
    With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.
    So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
    Until you're cheddar headed
    And watch the way I navigate
    Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Turn forever hand in hand
    Take it all in on your stride
    It is ticking, falling down
    Love forever, love is freely
    Turned forever, you and me
    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Is everybody in?

    Feel good
    Feel good
    Feel good
    Feel good

    Don't stop, get it, get it
    Peep how your captain's in it (Feel good)
    Steady, watch me navigate

    Don't stop, get it, get it
    Peep how your captain's in it (Feel good)

    ([META] SuicidalSushi and mindbleach: Slow your roll

    You two like to post a bunch of things about Homestuck from tumblr and the like. While I personally don't enjoy the content, you aren't breaking any rules, so my qualms are irrelevant.

    That being said, I do feel like there's a bit of an issue when I check /r/homestuck and I'm met with pages of posts by mindbleach or SuicidalSushi, with occasional breaks to show a post by someone else. You guys are obviously new-ish to this subreddit, so I'll explain you a thing. /r/Homestuck has always operated with discussion posts, communitystuck, and other such self-posts. These are now being absolutely <i>buried</i> by the nigh hourly posted links to "neat homestuck comix and art" 

    Clearly I'm in the minority here when I say this, judging from the upvotes you guys suck from lurkers. Though perhaps you will listen to an important figure here. (Note how I pretend that being important means I post comments here sometimes and more than 10 people know I exist.) I'm not asking you to stop, It's nice to have more posts, I just don't want it blotting out the discussion and more community-esque posts. Homestuck brought me to the sub, the community made me stay. This is true for many of us here, even if such a statement seems alien to veteran Redditors outside of /r/homestuck.)

    Well MatPat
    Well MatFat
    With the max stats
    Getting fat stacks

    Throwing up like ham in [??]
    Writing shitty mysteries like [??]
    [??]
    Looking for Sans, Mister Magoo from [??]
    [??] international association of [???] Sans
    Is not Ness

    (Which brings us back to Undertale. Three faces with "don't forget" written on it? It's Ness trying to remember his three friends. In short, Undertale is a continuation of Toby's version of EarthBound, with Ness never being able to get home, adopting the name Sans, and accompanied by Papyrus; a former Starman, an alien force able to speak English and still equipped with his armor and signature posture, but without any knowledge of earthly things, like the sun. The pieces all just seem to fit. Now all we need is an appearance from Pokey/Porky and we've got ourselves a true sequel! But hey, that's just a theory...

    A GAME THEORY! THANKS FOR WATCHING!)

Lyrics: |-
    I'm THINKING of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? The number I'm thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It's between four fifty and eight fifty. And it still happens to be between my buttocks. The higher this number is that's between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. Do you know what this number is? It's my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab it for me? I'm thinking that it's seven hundred and twenty, and that it's between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab it? It's a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and get it? I'm thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won't you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won't you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it's between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number that could save you a lot of money. It's between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and it is between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. It could save you a lot of money. A lot of money between my buttocks! But I'm thinking that this number is between four fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number is, although the highest can be eight hundred and fifty, the better chance you have of saving a lot of money. This number is between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. Hopefully this number is greater than four fifty and less than eight fifty. Otherwise it might not be your credit score! My credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which as you all have noticed, is between four fifty and eight fifty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Fortunately, seven hundred and twenty is this number, because it is between four hundred and fifty and eight hundred and fifty. But I'm thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be between my buttocks, and it could save you a lot of money. The higher this number between my buttocks is, the more money it could save you! I'm thinking of a number though, that is between my buttocks. It is still seven hundred and twenty. Won't you reach in and grab seven hundred and twenty for me? Don't grab four fifty or eight fifty, as these are the two extremes. These are not my free credit score. My free credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but I'm thinking that you can reach in and grab it because it is between my buttocks. The number between my buttocks happens to be, well, I'm thinking that it's seven hundred and twenty. But I could be wrong. Because your number could be anywhere between four fifty and eight fifty. I'm THINKING of a number...
