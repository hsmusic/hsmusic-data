    Cool and New Homestuck is some kind of horrifying amalgamation between Homestuck's iconic flash animations, and the CANWC Music Team's iconic shitty music. I tell a lie though, because we kind of forgot to make this album shit.

    whoops

Commentary: |-
    <i>Bambosh:</i>
    When it's a month until release, you're bored out of your mind, and you see the first slot in the album completely untouched, what do you do? Some would probably shoot a message back to the rest of the team, who are all no doubt more skilled than I am at composiion. Some would just leave it alone, rightfully assuming another team member would grab it. Or then you could just do what I did, max out microphone levels, and practically eat the thing for forty seconds. I'm ecstatic that this is the first thing people will see of Cool and New Homestuck, and I'll probably find it hilarious if anyone closes the album because of it. It's an incredible album, by the way. We've got some really talented people on the team, who went at it at full force. Great moves, guys. Keep it up. Proud of you.

    Oh and shoutouts to <s>Simpleflips</s> Noisemaker for buying an otamatone and willingly giving me a sample of it, despite knowing exactly what it was going towards.

    <i>Bambosh:</i> (413... TWO)

    Bambosh here again. [[artist:413]] was too tired to write any commentary and told me to markov chain it for him. I don't know why I'd do that though, when I've just been handed something like 22 boxes to shitpost in on a silver platter. Brace yourselves. If you see 413 as the artist [or composer] credit, it's gonna be me in the box. It's a Bambosh box. A Bambox.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Bambosh:</i> (substitute 413)
    I'm not sure what 413 did to make this song, but it sounds like he chucked the [[Showtime (Original Mix)|original Showtime chiptune]] into a midi converter and changed some of the midi instruments around. I kind of unironically love this song though. Despite how chaotic it is, it's inexplicably satisfying to listen to.

    Oh and by the way this one was an absolute pain to sync to the video. You'd think it would be easy, just chuck it over the thing and call it a day but no. There's only like 30 seconds of content in [[flash:90|the flash]], and no way to easily isolate the sound effects from the original song. As of writing this, I still don't have a solution. But hey there's still a week to release I'm sure it'll be fine hahahahahahahaha oh god help

    <i>olkiswerve:</i>
    So yeah, I worked on this one. It was a fairly simple GIMP shop where I just put some clip art, previously used assets and some text onto a picture of that one road that's famous because of the Beatles.<br>
    At this point I'd like to give a shoutout to skaia.io. Remember that shit? It's still going. I got a code, fuckers, haha, SK-RIDDLE-SOLVE. If that isn't a blast from the past, I don't know what is, I mean yeah how about that album art.

    <i>Noisemaker:</i>
    To be completely honest it's just [[track:cascante]] from [[album:cool-and-new-voulem1|Voulem 1]]. I regret not using my otamatone but at least [[artist:bambosh|Bambosh]] got some [[track:backyard-dumb|sweet use]] out of it.

    <i>Bambosh:</i> (supplement 413)
    I wasn't the original artist for this piece. I stole it. I stole the rights to use this piece. 413 was originally meant to do it, he made a concept and everything. In fact, I think it was one of the first things that ended up even being made for the album, several months ago. But then it just sat there, and people forgot it wasn't meant to be the final copy? So I just sort of swooped in and finished it off while nobody was looking.<br>

Commentary: |-
    <i>Minkt:</i>
    I really enjoyed the original Upward Movement, and felt that the new one would have to be even better to do the original justice. I have been infatuated with music that is more synthesised ever since I gave the Hotline Miami soundtrack a listen, so there is some inspiration there. The first version of this redvx had base midi drums and a guitar synthesizer and seemed off, so I looked up how to make synths like those in Hotline Miami and similar synthwave creations. After throwing on a new drum kit and synth, the song surprised me by actually sounding good. I'd like to thank Makin and others for giving the original a listen and telling me how to fix it, and the rest of the music and art team for putting out this COOL and NEW masterpiece. <a href="../../media/misc/JaedAngery.png">:JaedAngery:</a>

    <i>Makin:</i>
    I thought of how the Cool and New version of this flash would go, and I remembered how Jhon moved around once or twice. The joke was obvious after that.

    <i>Interrobang:</i>
    Let the record show that the dabe text in this artwork was so pixellated that I had to re-write over it, which is what you see now

    <i>Wheals:</i>
    Our one standard is that it has to be 1400x1400 (even though Bandcamp scales it down to 700x700!). So in redoing it, I decided to keep the original concept while using the freshest possible Bowmeme.

    Ost didn't give me any commentary, so I did it for them.

    I'm [[artist:ostrichlittledungeon|Ostrichlittledungeon]], and this is my Discord server. I work here with my musicians and artists, and my @Mod Assist, [[artist:miraculousavantgarde|Mira]]. Every song here has a story and a track art. One thing I've learned over the past 2 months? You never know what's gonna be in that album.

    <i>olkiswerve:</i>
    This is another silly meme one I did, as I tend to do. It's all about finding that perfect 「G O L D E N R A T I O」 of content to memes and meme spacing. Remember kids, you should read Jojostuck if you want to go to heaven.

    <i>flagellumVagueness:</i>
    It's pretty much just Dead Shuffle with crappier instrumentation and a few deliberately wrong notes. To mix it up a bit I changed the bassline to the melody for Licord Nacrasty in the 3rd "verse". Also, Heedful Fads is an anagram of Dead Shuffle, in case you were wondering.

    <i>olkiswerve:</i>
    This is the best serious cover I've done so far. It's fucking great. I love it and I'm super proud, even if it was a fairly simple job. I've also got a really nice version with the Vento Aureo gangsters, which I guess I'll use somewhere else if there's interest. But damn, this cover's great.

    <i>Minish:</i>
    I made the track art for this song using a frame I screenshotted from the flash itself, which you can find <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9wrqRmx.png">here</a>.  Also, the track art was actually cropped. If you want the original, you can find it <a href="../../media/album-additional/cool-and-new-homestuck/harleband.png">here</a>.

    I wanted to throw in a tiny bit of my signature crappy art for this album, and I decided to do something for this song. I wanted to have Dave doing some sci-fi thing but I wasn't sure what. Then someone suggested I should do naked Dabe in space, and that's what I did. I think it almost looks good with somewhat decent shading and a convincing space background stock photo.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Cecily Renns:</i>
    First song I made for the album. If you look hard into Black, the structuring is pretty weird. It goes 9 bars then it goes to normal 8 bars and it does THREE tempo changes. Thankfully, the MIDI I had covered all of these, so the syncing wasn't too hard.

    Musically, it's Black but with more COOL AND NEW MELODIES. Which consists of Archagent Everlasting, Unity of Thorns, and a bit of an original thing I composed in five minutes.

    The ending is not synced because WHAT THE FUCK I DONT EVEN KNOW. I didn't know how to solve it so I just made the ending a bit longer and there. Also it has "vaporwave go down" as [[artist:cookiefonster|cookie]] describes it replacing vaporwave [[Sburban Jungle]]. Thought it was a fun idea.

Lyrics: |-
    How do I
    Get through one night without you?
    If I had to live without you
    What kind of life would that be?
    Oh, and I
    I need you in my arms, need you to hold
    You're my world, my heart, my soul
    If you ever leave
    Baby that would take away everything
    Good in my life

    Without you
    There'd be no sun in my sky
    There'd be no love in my life
    There'd be no world left for me
    Oh, and I
    Baby I don't know what I would do
    I'd be lost if I lost you
    If you ever leave
    Baby that would take away everything that's
    Real in my life

    And tell me now
    How do I live without you?
    I want to know
    How do I breathe without you?
    If you ever go
    How will I ever, ever survive?

    Here comes the guitar solo
    Yeah
    Play that shit
    M M
    I hear ya, I hear you in here
    In my heart
    Mmm, so good on my eardrums
    Yeah
    You got that Telecaster twang

    The process of making this song was largely just seeing just how well I could wrangle this shitty ocarina I got for preordering Ocarina of Time 3D into doing what I wanted it to. I was originally going to sing the lyrics myself, but 413 was kind enough to lend TTS vocals, and there was no way I could look that gift horse in the mouth. The best you get is my shitty voice passed through seventy filters and used as a backing track. You're welcome.

    [[artist:413|413]] made some art for this, but it was waaaaay to small. We decided to instead use the original art for [[track:go-down-fanon-cut|Voul. 1's Go Down]] ([[artist:difarem|Dif]] didn't like it) instead. Did I mention we didn't ask Mira's permission to use it? No? Well, we didn't. What do you think this is, Pixar?

    go down is definitely my favorite vol 1 song. It is the complete opposite of [[track:descend|Descend]] - while Descend was loud, jam packed, filled with different motifs and sounds, and overall fucking crazy, go down is more simple, even... relaxing? Not *that* many motifs, but still enough to call it a great medley, combining different - at the time marginally related to CANWC - melodies.<br>
    I've always wanted to remix it, while keeping that simpleness to it. You can probably see that in the beginning - just piano, bass and Upward Movement drums. But as I continued with the song, it became probably as loud as Descend. It has what, 20 or something melodies in it now? Can't really keep track.<br>
    I think overall I did a good job of making a cohesive yet a diverse medley with different shit going on. Also I am keeping the fucking name. It is a good name

    I attempted to do something like this for the [[album:cool-and-new-volume-v|Doctor album]], but I found the Homestuck melody a lot easier to work with. This is also the first non-mashup musical project I've ever done, so congratulations to me for that.

    <i>Interrobang:</i>
    I decided that I wanted to make one of these cool and new tracks, and, being late in the game, this was the one of the only ones left that I felt I could do justice. As a challenge to myself, I decided that I would not use [[Penumbra Phantasm]] at all in the song, which proved to be fairly difficult. The song follows the same structure as the original, but with mostly different motifs that fit the characters shown at points in [[flash:2927|the flash]]. At the end, I was going to include something serious, but I decided to do something more high quality instead. Special thanks to [[artist:cecily-renns|JohnJRenns]] for the help with DVS Sax, and Destradious for making <a href="../../media/album-additional/homestuck-vol-6/Umbral%20Ultimatum%20-%20Destradious.mid">the MIDI</a> I based my song off of.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Griever:</i>
    This is just something to add hilarity to the whole GRIMDARK saga of Rose's life, which was a weird but fun little thing that happened in Homestuck. Grimdark as a concept is kinda paradoxically making fun of itself but also completely serious, so I started thinking "man this reminds me of shadow the hedgehog". So I added some edgy memes in there, and the thing about Advanced Darkness, because that's some good shit. Metal Gear Rising, gunshots, and dog barks added oomph to the second half of it, and I love it. I like listening to this song and watching the video, even if it's dumb. Hopefully you do too.

    Shadow The Hedgehog was a legitimately fun game for me, despite how dumb it is. That kinda goes for Sonic Adventure 2, now that I think of it. It's weird to think how randomly edgy those two games were. There was a mad scientist ridden with grief because the government killed his dying daughter for no god damn reason, so he goes fucking crazy and has a plan to commit worldwide genocide because of it. That's pretty fucking hardcore if you ask me. But then Shadow The Hedgehog seemed to not entirely get why Sonic Adventure 2 was reasonable while it wasn't. Suddenly all the "edge" parts got played up to almost goofy levels (it's like taking candy from a baby, WHICH IS FINE BY ME), as opposed to the "ridiculous" parts being played up (NO DON'T TOUCH THAT LEVER, AHHHHH!!!). There's a difference between kids suddenly being confronted with a madman's delusions and then going in to fight a lizard, and between kids suddenly meeting Goku Satan and doing odd jobs for him and/or fighting him. The thing is that Shadow The Hedgehog takes its edge too seriously, while Sonic Adventure 2 balanced it out with, well, not subtlety (it wasn't an amazing story), but rather a half of the cast not really giving a shit about the edge.

    This was the first song I made for Cool and New Homestuck. When I first learned about that project I decided to do music for a flash that probably wouldn't be too popular, because I thought there would be a lot of fights over who gets to do music for flashes like Cascade and stuff. That turned out not to be true but whatever. Anyway, for this one I basically decided to make a piece to the likes of Terezi Owns out of multiple Dave motifs, so I used the classic drums from Upward Movement like in the original song and threw in some Atomyk Ebonpyre and some Beatdown, and later on I directly quoted Terezi Owns.

    I wasn't even originally going to do alternate music for this one. Originally this one was just going to use the existing song, "[[track:divine-justice-overload|Divine Justice: Overload]]". But when it turned out that wasn't allowed I decided to claim that one. It was originally going to be a collaboration between me and Shwan, where I would write the MIDI file and he would do glitch effects and add a transition between the beginning and main section and master it overall. But when Cerulean shared with me a mix of the intro in his musical style, I liked it so much that I let him [[track:deaf-injustice-ignoration-no-effects-ver|mix the whole song]] that way, and left Shwan to handle the glitch effects; the addition of Bowman's Credit Score glitches was a very pleasant surprise.<br>
    When I wrote this song, I wasn't sure what to do at one point, so I just repeated the main theme and added the [[track:rollercoaster-tycoon-theme|RCT theme song]], which is good because mixing that song into stuff is sort of our signature thing. Turns out the glitch effects largely destroyed that section due to flash syncing.

    <i>Shwan:</i>
    It was really fun messing around with audacity,i love it. Also i love fucking things up

    <i>Bambosh:</i> (not 413)
    Okay I couldn't find a way to do markov chains easily, but I've found a random sentence generator so that's the next best thing. The capital bear undertakes the lifetime. The event handicaps whatever daytime northern. The sword storms into the overwhelming advice. The supermarket grabs the widest disclaimer beside the dance. And that's it. I think this is the last piece 413 did for CANH. Writing these shitposts out has been an absolute journey.

    Since it's ¾ beat so i decide to put in RCT since its our main theme. It was pretty fun. I also really love using music box as an instruments.

    <i>VulkanShawl:</i>
    Well. My first idea was "Edit a RCT image and put Gamzee and the other trolls of the flash" but i didn't knew how so i put a Space Rollercoaster with Gamzee in while he's launching Tavros' head. Also a friend said Tavros' blood looks like... y'know shit.

Lyrics: |-
    (You're going to love this, trust me. What you're seeing now is my normal state. This is a Super Saiyan. And this. This is what is known as a Super Saiyan that has ascended above a Super Saiyan.) (That ain't Falco!) (Or, you could just call this a Super Saiyan 2. Just wait.) (You just—) (Aw.) (That up smash.)

    (I don't like where this is going.) (Has he really found a way to surpass an ascended Saiyan? Is that possible?) (He must be bluffing, I mean what would that make him? Double ascended?) (AND THIS.) (Eh, what's he doing?) (IS TO GO EVEN FURTHER BEYOND!)

    (Happy Feet, wombo combo!) (No, stop it Goku! If you do this now it's going to drain away all the time you have left on Earth!) (That ain't Fal— [screaming] Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? Oh! Oh my God, Wombo Combo!)

    (Ngh! It's unreal! How is he generating that much power?) (Oh! Get yo ass whooped!) (What the FUCK was that?) (What the fu—) (What the FUCK, man?) (Wombo Combo!) (Wow!) [unintelligible] (Naw, not yet.) (My freaking dick hurts!) (When— when the set's over.) (My dick hurts!) (Boback's dick is hard!) (Oh my God, we're all a little bit hard.) (Anything to sa—)

    (Stop it! Stop it now Goku!)

    (Fool me once - I'm mad. Fool me twice - How could you? Fool me three times - You're officially that guy, okay? You know him, you know the one. You go to the bar and he's like, 'This suit is, uh, officially it's a Giorgio Armani, ech my dad knows him!' Fuck you! I AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIN'T HAVIN' THAT SHIT!) (JoooooooooJo!)

    (Memes. The DNA of the soul.) (It's me, Austin!) (Aw, son of a bitch!) (What??) (It's me, Austin! It was me all along, Austin!) (I'm sorry that took so much longer than the others. But I haven't had much occasion to practice this one. This is what I call a Super Saiyan 3.)

    <i>Griever:</i>
    This song is supposed to really give you the sense that you first had when you saw this part of [[flash:4109|Cascade]]. It's fucking beautiful, it all fits together, it's hype, and there was probably some amount of crazy screaming. It's also here to remind you that fucking Dragon Ball Z was the shit, and it really pioneered ascension scenes as a whole.

    Anyways, I first made this song not knowing it would sync up to the video at all, actually. I just got lucky to be honest. Hopefully you enjoy!

    Well, the scene that the audio is taken from is the Super Saiyan Three scene in DBZ, so I just used a frame from that and put Jhon's head on it. I also added screaming things. This song is about creating something both cool and new out of nostalgic things - things that you've lived through your childhood with. Dragon Ball Z, Homestuck, they're both big parts of my young life. So this song in all its shitposty glory, IS something cool and new and fun and fresh and exciting, in my opinion, even if it just throws a bunch of memes onto a good song.

    open up
    <i>what</i>
    its the police, MSUIC POLICE
    <i>what did i do</i>
    you are using an excess of Orchestral Bullshit™ in your music and it is unacceptable
    <i>ok</i>
    you are going away for a LONG time, mother fucker
    <i>ok</i>

    <i>cookiefonster:</i>
    For this one, Cecily was the one who did most of the work. I mostly just made draft versions of the Negastrife sections, and I also made the honk sound effects as follows. When Cecily sent me her mix of the song, he left out the honk sound effects and let me do those. Soon enough, I had the PERFECT idea for that: phrases associated with each of his soul components in a slowed down text to speech voice. And which voice could I ever do but the hilarious WillFromAfar?<br>
    The honk sound effects are the following phrases combined: "Haa haa hee hee hoo hoo", "I need a towel", "I'm glasses", and "Miracles", for Caliborn, Equius, Lil' Hal, and Gamzee respectively. The funny thing is, "I need a towel" and "I'm glasses" sort of blend together to sound like "I need glasses", the same way those phrases' associated characters combined to make Arquiusprite. Also, because of Caliborn's signature laugh, it actually did end up sounding somewhat like a honk.

    <i>Makin:</i>
    For those with no childhood or those who aren't insane enough to look at this art, this is that one part from Little Red Riding Hood where the main character, I think she was called Vaska or something, discovers that the main baddie is cosplaying as her grandmother with a vore fetish. The details are fuzzy, but seriously, we already have a Bad Wolf villain, god damn it whoever decided this song name making me resort to centuries old stories in order to meme.

    Also I fucked up the line quality at some point while using the bucket tool, sorry for that. Hopefully it doesn't look awful in your music player of choice.

    <i>Cecily Renns:</i>
    [[artist:miraculousavantgarde|Mira]] came up with this idea of "act transitions" jokingly actually ; with just the names "Cool and New Act 1, Cool and New Act 2" et cetra. Then I just picked some major motifs from each act and made this. I was gonna do more than piano and bass, but this sounds good enough, The minimalistic nature accompanies the idea of it being just short transitions.

    The very last one is ~~END OF DISC 1~~, which I made after all the other ones because I wanted a song with that name and it could serve as a gateway to the NEXT ALBUM WHICH WILL FEATURE ACT 6 AND YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE IT IN LIKE TWO MONTHS.

    <i>miraculousAvantgarde:</i>
    This album was a waste of everyone's time.

    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    How stupid do you feel now?
