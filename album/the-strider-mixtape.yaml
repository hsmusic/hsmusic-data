    <i>Pascal van den Bos:</i> (booklet commentary)

    I wanted to try to make a dubstep song for Dave since he was originally supposed to be an EDM producer before everyone started making hip hop songs for him. I had never made a dubstep song before, or anything like this for that matter so it was quite a challenge. I also wanted to reference [[track:coolkid]] by [[artist:haunter]] from [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-b|colours and mayhem universe b]] since I think it's an awesome song and i haven't seen it referenced anywhere yet.

    I started this with the idea of a Kurloz song in mind but i later realized i didnt need a kurloz song as much as i needed a Cal song, why was i making a Kurloz song? no idea! Either way i had only written the piano and some heartbeats when i decided to make this a song for Cal. I used a lot of samples from the game WarioWare D.I.Y since they all sound very wacky and sometimes eerie, perfect for cal lol. I also used the SOM chants that were used in versus to represent Cal's voice.

    One day i was trying to recreate [[track:versus]] by [[artist:toby-fox]]. I got some of the start and then i just gave up and decided to remix the song as a theme for Dave's bro. I used some crow sound effects because there are always plenty of unwanted crows around where Dave and Bro live, and i used some disk scratches here and there for max coolness.

    Ever since i heard [[track:davesprite2|Davesprite 2]] for the first time i've wanted to remix it in some way. When i had to make the song for Davesprite on this album i knew what i wanted to do, so i sent [[artist:erik-scheele]] a message on Twitter asking if he still had the project file for Davesprite 2, and he did! With this song i basically tried to make a finished version of Davesprite 2 while throwing in some stuff of my own like the [[track:temporal-virtuoso]] reference.

    <i>Pascal van den Bos:</i> (booklet commentary)

    This is another attempt at me trying a different genre than what i'm used to, i wanted to make a Lo-Fi beat for Dirk. I had a song in mind that he would maybe listen to while working on robots or something like that. I also sampled a bit from Starsky & Hutch at the beginning for obvious reasons that need no explanation. (Fun fact, the title of the song was a wip title for the album itself).

    So i was watching some old Pokemon movies and i got a bit inspired by the music in said old Pokemon movies, i wanted to make a part orchestral piece for the epic Brobot battle that takes place in [[flash:4572|[S] Prince of Heart: Rise Up.]] When i finished the song i posted it in the Music channel to see if anyone had feedback, when i checked back [[artist:funk-mclovin|JoJo]] had offered to play live trumpet since the horns i used were pretty trashy, so obviously i took that and now the song sounds amazing.

    Hey another attempt at a genre i'm unfamiliar with, i wanted to make a Synthwave track to fit with the theme of 2001: A Space Odyssey references like the title and the art for Hal. After this i actually made a full synthwave album because i liked the genre so much.

    One day i stayed up till the sun came up and i just sampled a bit from a [[track:very-ape|Nirvana song]] and slapped the base for this song together. I finished the rest later when i wasnt half asleep. I wanted it to be a very powerful sounding song for Dirk's epic mysterious bro who kills juggalo's for a living, i think i got that down pretty well so i just threw some random references in it too cause i felt it was a little empty.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Pascal van den Bos:</i> (booklet commentary)

    With this song the 2 leads (which are a square and a saw instrument) are supposed to be Sawtooth and Squarewave singing/rapping over the beat. It's kind of like a rap battle between the two. This song is also very inspired by Sonic music, lol. This song is probably also cursed because it crashed 3 times forcing me to recreate it by ear from the last wip i exported, so it almost didn't exist.<br>
    But of course us over at [[group:paradox-music-team|PMT]] have the most epic DETERMINATION B)

    Dave already produced music before he became Davepetasprite^2 or even Davesprite, so with this song i tried to make something that Davepetasprite^2 would make. A song with influences from Dave and Nepeta, that means lots of MarioPaint but PHAT MarioPaint.

    This is a song i made about a year ago, i later remixed it into a theme for a planet in a fansession and then recently into a theme for Jack. But this is the original version. I tried to make a song that was upbeat and kinda sad and slow too, perfect fit for the [[flash:4109|battle vs. Bec when Bro died]], so that's what i decided to clean it up and use it for.

    This was originally made for a Homestuck fighting game, it was meant to play on the Strider stage.<br>
    But since then not much has happened with that project, so i decided to clean up the song and use it for this album. It's a remix of [[track:versus]] with some [[track:beatdown-strider-style|other stuff]] in there.

    I wanted this to be like a shitty remix of the [[track:gamebro-original-1990-mix|GameBro theme]] made by Dave in his bedroom, shitty mic and all. I also hate recording vocals for things now because this took a while and it still sounds horrible lmao.
Lyrics: |-
    alright bros are you ready
    its time for the one the only gamebro
    hes coming to your screen
    straight from the magazine

    the gamebro is here and hes got the game
    all you other lamebrainer better feel the shame
    he can bend the rules hes too cool for school
    and hes got just a few cheat codes for you
    there aint nothing thatll ever hold this bad boy down
    that hat that hes wearing like his personal crown
    hes got every game beat and skills that sweet
    but if you want in his crew you gotta be elite
    youve gotta be on the spot on the dot were just saying
    youve gotta be ready to go if youre too slow thanks for playing
    youve gotta know where its at whos at bat and if you dont then
    well then youll know just who to call

    its gamebro
    when youre out of quarters hes got your back
    he never ever betray you man thats a fact
    yo hes your best friend and never foe
    so come on and lets go

    youve gotta be on the spot on the dot were just saying
    youve gotta be ready to go if youre too slow thanks for playing
    youve gotta know where its at whos at bat and if you dont then
    well then youll know just who to call

    the games will never stop the games will never stop

    This song is heavily based off [[track:versus]], i wanted to make a more happy song based on Versus to play when Dave is battling alongside Dirk to show that he's happier after all the stuff that happened with Bro. Kind of like a post scratch version of Versus as [[artist:caelan-kier]] puts it, lol.
