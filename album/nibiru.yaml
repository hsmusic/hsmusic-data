Lyrics: |-
    (One-two-three-four)

    Who am I and who are you?
    The line between us is becoming unclear
    I despise me and I know you hate me too
    Let me drown my sorrows for a little while more

    Who am I and who are you? (Are you? Are you?)
    The line between us is becoming unclear (Becoming unclear)
    I despise me and I know you hate me too
    Let me drown my sorrows for a little while more

    A little while more
    A little while more
    A little while more
    A little while more

    A little while more

    iirc Redeye was the first new Desynced song I’ve written in nearly 3ish years. I remember feeling invigorated by the release of [[album:anthology-i|Anthology I]] and I had a fresh demo for this song the evening after it came out. I’ve had concepts for this song sitting around since around 2021 and it was exciting to finally get a chance to execute it. I knew even back then that I wanted to combine elements of EDM and Rock/Metal but I didn’t really know how to pull it off. It was only after I started listening to Nine Inch Nails in 2023 that I found myself able to complete the song. The song leans in heavily on that distinct Reznor brand of industrial Rock while combing aspects of VGM and EDM. It might not be entirely evident, but the song was influenced by Toby Fox’s approach to [[track:vriskas-theme|“Vriska’s Theme.”]] In his commentary for Alterniabound, he talked about how he wrote that song to depict Vriska’s depression and angst. Layssah, much like Vriska, experiences a lot of self-loathing and I wanted to convey that in Redeye. To do that, I decided to do something I’ve never done before: putting vocals in a track. I am by no means a lyricist, but I figured it would help convey my intentions for the song as well as give me a reason to bust out SynthV. It’s not the best tuning or vSynth programing in the world but I think it does an okay enough job. It’s the best produced song I’ve ever made, I’ll give it that.

    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS2T5DO8Dhk), excerpt)

    Now going from the newest song on the album to one of the oldest. I did a decent amount of composition for this track in 2020/2021 iirc. Unlike [[track:redeye-nibiru|Redeye]], LSoH was a fully formed piano draft that was left to sit for 3ish years. I knew when Niberu was coming together that I’d finally get my chance to finish the song. Compositionally, the song is pretty much identical to the original draft I wrote in 2020/2021. Production-wise however, it’s an entirely new song. Romelia’s kinda spooky and I wanted her song to ooze “B-Horror Movie” energy. I took a lot of influence from the expected Halloween esque songs but also took cues from Hip Hip and Glitch pop production. [“Pac-Man”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-7U-FDql1A&pp=ygUQcGFjLW1hbiBnb3JpbGxheg%3D%3D) by Gorillaz and [“After Third Heaven”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqJfkS3LFXA&pp=ygUSYWZ0ZXIgdGhpcmQgaGVhdmVu) by Death’s dynamic Shroud were major influences. It's just a very normal song where nothing bad ever happens :^)

Lyrics: |-
    (A two, a one, two, three)

    I saw you at the mall last night  <!-- 27:37 -->
    You were looking pretty under the flashing lights, of that storefront
    You were talking with your friends
    And I kinda wished that I was them
    'Cause I'm begging, I'm begging,
    I'm begging now, baby I'm down on my knees
    Baby, baby, please can you listen?
    When I say

    Pretty miss you drive me crazy  <!-- 28:03 -->
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-heart

    I turned up the stereo  <!-- 28:33 -->
    And I always seem to catch you
    Tried to look so far, for a sign in the stars
    But they all point right back at you
    Your face gets plastered across space
    So I can't escape or forget you
    So I'm begging, I'm begging, I'm begging
    Oh baby I'm down on my knees
    Baby please can you listen?
    When I say

    Pretty miss you drive me crazy  <!-- 28:58 -->
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    And you're tearing me apart
    Oh, pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-heart

    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  <!-- 29:36 -->
    'Cause I'm begging, I'm begging  <!-- 29:45 -->
    I'm begging now, baby I'm down on my knees
    'Cause I'm begging, I'm begging
    I'm begging now, baby I'm down on my knees
    Baby, baby, please can you listen?
    When I say

    Pretty miss you drive me crazy  <!-- 36:00 -->
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy  <!- 30:13 -->
    And you're tearing me apart
    Oh, pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy  <!-- 30:25 -->
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my,
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy  <!-- 30:37 -->
    And you're tearing me apart
    Oh, pretty miss you drive me crazy
    I think that I cannot go

Lyrics: |-
    Underneath the city lights  <!-- 30:55 -->
    A new dawn finally begins
    I am shedding old skin
    I am breaking free from your chains
    There's no more tears, there's no more pain
    There's just laughter in the air
    In the aftermath of love
    My solace is not rare

    As the stage shines bright  <!-- 31:16 -->
    Bright as the distant sun
    I feel free
    Proud that I decided to run
    There's no more tears, there's no more pain
    There is but not one lesson learned
    In this universe of love
    My happiness is earned

    In the light  <!-- 31:35 -->
    The light where we once stood hand in hand
    I am twirling solo
    I am taking but one chance
    As the cheers begin to roar
    As my happiness soars
    I stand tall to play my part
    Let this ephemeral countdown finally start

    In the light  <!-- 32:23 -->
    The light where we once stood hand in hand
    I am twirling solo
    I am taking but one chance
    As the cheers begin to roar
    As my happiness soars
    I stand tall to play my part
    Let this ephemeral countdown finally start

    In the light  <!-- 33:39 -->
    The light where we once stood hand in hand
    I am twirling solo
    I am taking but one chance
    As the cheers begin to roar
    As my happiness soars
    I stand tall to play my part
    Let this ephemeral countdown finally start

    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEOxHLrWOQg), excerpt)

    Here’s the big one. [[artist:dizzims|Dizzims]] asked for two versions of Niberu’s main theme to bookend the album and given that I was already doing [[track:nibiru|the opener]], I decided to do the closer as well. The process from there saw the song evolve in ways that I didn't expect. I managed to get a decent melody that I wound up using for the opener and an ostinato figure, but I couldn’t figure out how to put them together into a full song. Given that [[artist:levc|Levc]] wrote the main theme of Desynced, I decided to reach out for his help on this track. Much like our other collabs we tossed a project file back and forth adding and tweaking stuff until we got a finished product. I think the big difference from those other times we’ve worked together is how much better we play off against each other here. This track is the [[track:flying-witch|second]] collab between me and Levc ([[track:strobelite-striker|third]] if you count VE) and it shows. The track’s a sprawling epic, spanning multiple phases over its 4-minute run time. The song was influenced by [[track:another-medium|“Another Medium”]] by Toby Fox but I think it goes above and beyond that initial influence imo. The track has 2 recurring melodic motifs meant to represent the opposing forces that make up Niberu: mechanism and naturalism. The idea came from [[album:undertale-soundtrack|Undertale]] and how that game’s main theme has the “hopes” and “dreams” motifs I really like the way we managed to arrange the two melodies in such a way as to embody the meaning of those themes. The ostinato figure unifies it all together in a way that is so satisfying. It’s probably the most ambitious song either of us have done for Desynced. There’s a familiar motif at the end but that’s a story for another day.

    This was the first ever song I made for desynced lol.<br>
    You have no idea how many revisions this went through.<br>
    Took forever to get someone to play guitar for it, but sometimes you just gotta learn to do things yourself :3
