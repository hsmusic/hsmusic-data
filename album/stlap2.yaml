    This song was basically made out of my love for the Alpha kids planets, this one in particular was supposed to be a kinda chill theme for the Land of Tombs and Krypton. The version you hear on the album took several hours as I was very critical and indecisive about what I was writing. In the end I'm proud of what's here but one day I'd like to [[track:miasmic-resurrection|revisit the song]] and hopefully fix the parts I was super unsure about.

    This was initially going to be a recreation, utilizing the Secret of Mana soundfont used in the original song. I decided to try out some of the same instruments used in [[track:stronger-monsters]] (from Undertale) as well, which at that point I thought "what the heck, let's just make a full-on remix of this". Fun fact: I was initially following along [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|PotatoBoss']] [Versus recreation video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYfZBrReslY), before I knew who he was.

    I made this song as a birthday gift to [[artist:rowyn-berlan]], i wanted to kind of parody [[album:the-baby-is-you|"The Baby is You"]] since we had just finished ["The Baby is STLaP2"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqi0iMdsva_wMBDC1dZgYmg--sJgtXtmG) and it seemed funny to me to make that for them. The only song I referenced was [[track:miasmic-decay|"Miasmic Decay"]] because Rowyn made it and that would make the song still fit in the album because it's still a remix of a song in the album. Also DVS-Saxophone is the best instrument, change my mind.

    Anyvvay, it’s mostly a Crystal remix simply because nearly e<ery time I make something I can feel this song trying to inch it’s vvay in there, so I scratched that itch and ga<e it it’s ovvn song to try to hold it back.

    This [[track:crystalanthemums|Crystal]] remix is actually my first attempt at a song with entirely digital-sounding instruments (I.e. saws, squares, DVS sax and the like) but it survived the dreadful soundtest so..

    Anyway, it’s mostly a Crystal remix simply because nearly every time I make something I can feel this song trying to inch it’s way in there, so I scratched that itch and gave it it’s own song to try to hold it back.

Also [[track:unite-synchronization|unite synchronization]] is in here somewhere so that’s cool.  <!-- no signature in booklet -->

    I wanted to make a beatdown remix that was kind of beach-y i suppose? So basically i took [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]], some upbeat drums, Earthbound beach sounds, \*DVS SAX\* and some other cool stuff. I ended up with a pretty cool result, it was basically exactly what i wanted. Near the end i also sampled the original Beatdown for a cool effect, and also at the end because i wanted to make it sound as if you were sitting on the beach, listening to Beatdown through a small radio. The Vriska references where just kinda there because they sound good with the rest, they are in squarewave to match Dave’s intrumentation. And lastly the name is also obviously a reference to Beatdown.

    <i>Caelan Kier:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    I listen to a lot of prog-metal-that’s-also-very-melodic, a good example is Sithu Aye, who is the main inspiration behind this song, I love the way he keeps this melodic flow throughout pretty much every song and has like every other instrument that’s not the lead dedicated to just backing up this melody; So I thought it would be a good idea to turn this style into chiptune. It’s different than my usual chiptune style, and I guess that just kinda developed as I made the song, but honestly I like the way this sounds more than my normal style so I’ll probably make more songs like this. I wanna say more but that’s p much it lol.

    This song is a redone version of an old Lo-Fi Hip-Hop remix i made of the song [[track:moonsetter|“Moonsetter”]] by Toby Fox. I didn’t like the old one i made but since i was getting so much positive feedback on it i decided to remake it for this album. It turned out way better than the old version in my opinion and i hope everyone who listened to the old version agrees with me.

    <i>apatheticPianist:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    Tbh this’s one of my fav songs I’ve ever made? For a few reasons, one being that admittedly it was made in GarageBand and yet isn’t (totally) awful-sounding instrument-wise, and another being that swapping the “main” instruments of Dave’s and John’s motifs worked out really well, imo, and finally cuz it’s from a transitional period right before I got better software and so sort of marks a personal turning point on the path towards becoming a better composer? It’s a pretty nice jam, regardless of all that, and [[track:spacetime-continuum|I might wind up doing]] either a remaster of it or a version with Jade and Rose for STLaP3 - hope y’all enjoy listening!

    So this was made back when [[album:alternate-hues-and-melodies|AHaM]] was being made, pretty close to it being released the guy who was making the Sollux song didn't finish it for reasons I can't be bothered remembering, and since the position for the Sollux song was open I was like "damn I wanna do the Sollux song because Sollux is cool". So I made the first melody you hear in [[Distortion Navigator]], but before I could do anymore we had to release the album like right then and there, so I didn't get to finish it. Then I just turned it into the full Sollux song I wanted back then and released it here on STLaP 2 instead.

    A requiem for those not lucky enough to sur<i<e Sburb. One cannot keep a gentle touch and sur<i<e. Rebirth, vvithout elegance. They must steel themsel<es, and knovv vvhat to do; vvhy to do it. True is resol<e. After all, the game is young. R.E.T.R.Y. GAME.

    The length is actually a bit of an accident on my end. Sometimes there are just so many inter<als and melodies that need their part, and each one of those need *some* kind of transition. Not sure if it shovvs or not, but this is certainly the track I vvorked hardest on, and ironically I made my longest track at a point vvhere vve had no more room on the album!

    I remember like thinking that [my Mutiny remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3znbbnDOChY) could be totally better, so like I only made this a while after that was uploaded (that's why it sounds so much like my old stuff). I didn't even plan for the song to be said remix, I was just bored in FL Studio and placed down the [[track:mutiny|Mutiny]] melody in there and somehow just kept going until it turned into a full song. I was gonna put it in [[album:stlap|STLaP 1]], but then didn't because [[track:fetch-the-bullet|there was already a Mutiny remix]], so first chance I got I dunked it into STLaP 2.

    A while ago, i worked on an album called [[album:solar-sessions|“Solar Sessions”]] hosted by “Handshake Collaborations”. On this is a song called [[track:earth-solar-sessions|“Earth”]] by psithurist. I was extremely inspired by this song because it’s so good, so i tried to make something in that style. The way it came out, it was pretty perfect for a chill Derse kinda song so i ended up putting it on STLaP 2.

    <i>Rowyn Berlan:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    Now [[track:candles-and-clockwork|Candles and Clockwork]] over the years has become my favorite song from Homestuck so of course I wanted to try and do something with it. Candlelit originally started out as [[track:candlelit-contemplation-beta|a shitty PXTone cover]] that’s on my YouTube Channel (you’ve been warned) and well after a while I grew unhappy with it. One day I got the stupid idea to reverse the song and boy am I glad I did that. I decided to try and make a remix of Candles and Clockwork that would sound just as good reversed and well what’s there sure is something. (By the way all the reversed bits are actually from the original PXTone version which I thought was a cool little reference)

    So this one is pretty odd (obviously wtf). One day i was hanging out on the Bowman Discord server and we were just kinda talking, so then Michael mentions that him and some friends are making a Strider version of the vocals to [[track:cory-in-the-house-theme-song|the Cory in the House opening]], and i was like, ohshit i can make a remix of the theme that uses Strider motifs if you want :eyes:. So i made it and i named the instrumental version CITH Beatdown as a reference to [[track:wsw-beatdown|WSW Beatdown]]. Later the vocals were added and it became Strider in the House. Thanks for making this Michael your Dave voice is epic lmao.

    <i>Michael Parker:</i> (Dave, booklet commentary)

    This entire concept started as a joke between me and my friends, “what if you took Dave Strider and put him in Cory in the House”. It was a meme, a dumb idea I did and even drew art for. We came up with a whole scenario and description of “the show”. Then we were like “what if we made a parody of an intro”, and I contacted PotatoBoss and proposed the concept. I was honestly shocked when he agreed to make an instrumental remix of Cory in the House. Over the span of around a month or two, we made the music, got myself and my friend to record the lyrics, and then made it a video on youtube. Now it’s making an appearance on this album, which boggles my mind. I voice Dave Strider, while my friend Bun sings as Vriska. Making this was extremely fun, since I have no musical talent whatsoever, but enjoy working with PMT on their various projects. Everyone in PMT is so talented, and as cheesy as it sounds, it’s an honor to be able to contribute to this album and work with them. To be honest, this shitpost is probably my magnum opus, but I am perfectly fine with that.

    <i>The Pure Spectre:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    So, this song apparently started way back in 2017, where it was just a mere shadow of it’s current self. Simply put, it was the main beginning bit, ‘cept it was at a slower tempo, and sounded decently worse than it does now. I had it lying around when I joined the PMT, and decided it has potential. So, I took it, looked closely at how [[Black]] actually played, and made it into a more fully-fledged remix. Can I say it’s my best work? Probably not. But I would, at the very least, hope that it’s decently enjoyable to listen to if anything.

    Funnily enough, when I uploaded the song to SoundCloud (where it suffered in quality from the upload, unfortunately) I mentioned in the description that it was likely to be my last Homestuck song/remix. Apparently, I was lying to everyone including myself, since I not only made another song for the STLaP2 album, but I’ve got a larger project in the works... a project being made in the most unorthodox ways, but being created nonetheless.

    This song has a special place in my heart because it my first homestuck remix. I started this song months before I joined the PMT and I remember doing it out of boredom. I wanted to make remix a song the no one had done before, so I decided to remix the first half of the unreleased song [[track:jadesprite|"Jadesprite."]] The [[track:spritely-gardener-beta|original demo]] of the song was like 30 seconds long and wasn't very good imo. Joining the team gave me the impetus I needed to expand upon my original demo and finish the song. Of my remixes, this one is probably my favorite.

    <i>Pascal van den Bos:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    One day i was just listening to [[track:davesprite|“Davesprite”]] by Toby Fox and i was trying to recreate the opening drums. Since i always wanted to remix Davesprite i decided to just lay down the main melody too and remix the song. This song probably took longest to make, not because it was harder than the rest, but because it kept being edited. The first time was because i messed up some notes and pitching, the i removed some parts for no reason which i ended up adding back later. Then i got some disc scratch samples from [[artist:erik-scheele|Erik Scheele]] that sounded really cool so i added those in, that took a while to get decent too. And still with this version i’m not 100% satisfied but it’ll do. And the name is “Davesprite 3” because there’s an unused song by Erik Scheele called [[track:davesprite2|“Davesprite 2”]] so i just followed up after that.

    This track was actually a commission for a fantroll theme. I basically just based the entire song off one motif that i used from Lust, the rest of the song was based off the track [[track:virgin-orb|“Virgin Orb”]] by Toby Fox. I promised 2 commissioners that i would use their fantroll themes in STLaP 2 and [[track:i-warned-you-about-the-elevator-bro|i did]]. I’m kinda glad i did too because i really like the songs.

    [[artist:rowyn-berlan]] and i were once in a fansession, there she made a song titled: “Deception” which she still hates with a flaming passion, even though i don’t think it’s that bad, around the time that she made that i tried to remix it into a sort of really fast battle theme based on [[Umbral Ultimatum]] by Toby Fox. At first this song sounded really different because i had used sounds from games like Goemon on Nintendo 64 and Earthbound, then i tried to use more orchestral sounds and it just sounded way better. So in the end i think it came out really well for what it is, \*Umbral Ultimatum 2\* B)

    I had the idea for for a jazzy version of [[track:cascade-beta|“Cascade”]] for a while. As I started making however, it slowly but surly turned into a remix of [[track:flare-cascade-cut|“Flare (Cascade Cut).”]] I also added a little bit of [[track:liquid-negrocity|“Liquid Negrocity”]] for added jazziness. I’m pretty sure that this song sucks at being jazz but is pretty alright in being a song.

I’m quite happy with how the song turned out and how well I was able to blend in and sorta balance the melodies of both songs. In conclusion CaveStory’s great and Homestuck’s great nuff said.

    Prior to making this song me and my girlfriend had been watching a lot of the anime “Saiki-K” and the music in that is extremely good. When i got to my computer i wanted to write a song like the beach theme in Saiki. That’s where the beginning came from, after that it just became a mesh of a bunch of different things. At some point i just started to add different Homestuck motifs and stuff like the voice clips from Strider in the House. And also Deception, aka, The best song ever made. In the end it turned out as one of my favorite songs that i made for this album. Mayor props to wumby for the art as well, it’s really good.

    I know there has already been [[track:dungeness-showdown|a remix of showdown on a PMT album before]] (sorry Calikid), but I really wanted to do a hard rock version of the song so oh well. Funnily enough it was that remix on AHaM that inspired me to write Threxecute, so i guess it’s fine???. This song is also the most controversial song I have ever written. I will admit that part of it was my own stubbornness, but I will also admit that I didn’t think that UGK2 would sound good with this song.

    So I had this idea for doing solo album in the style of [[album:strife|strife]] and [[album:strife-2|strife 2]]. One of the song ideas I had for the album was remix of the song [[track:temporal-virtuoso|“Temporal Virtuoso”]] by PB. I eventually decided against doing that in favor of different solo album idea, but I still wanted to do a remix of the song. I tried my best to create an [[artist:robert-j-lake|RJ Lake]] style remix, chopping up various sections of the song and stitching them together. I even added a reference to [[track:perfect-cascade-of-the-heart|“Perfect Cascade of the heart”]] by Tensei. I’m pretty satisfied with how this turned out and I hope you enjoy. ([[album:p-s|P.[S].]] You guys gotta start remixing more strife 2 songs. The album will be out 2 years by the time you read this and the lack of remixes is disappointing.)

    Note that this particular commentary piece is being written somewhat prematurely in my eyes, as the song is technically unfinished as of writing. Not my fault for doing so - there was a deadline on these.

    So this song wasn’t planned to be in this album at all. Instead, a more ambitious project of mine was going to be in it’s place, one that’s more related to cherubs and such. However, it became increasingly apparent that, if I were to try and finish it in a timely manner, it would likely turn out as a - excuse me when I say this - shit pile on fire. That’s to say, terribly. So, I’m reserving it for the next album, one where I can have time to acclimate to new software and actually make a good product.

    In it’s place, we have this sort of Descend/Upward Movement remix that I managed to cook up in the spare time away from my main PC. It turned out alright, but according to [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|Mr. P-Boss]], equalization on it was quite poor. It was an understanble and true statement - the software I used for it wasn’t really made to equalize.

    Because of this fact, he actually offered to take the midi file of the song and the audio file and convert it into a more equalized, and hopefully better sounding, version. As of writing this, I’ve yet to hear anything about it though. This description will be changed if he does end up following through. If he doesn’t, then what you’ll be hearing is my version of it, and this description will be left unchanged. In any case, I hope it’s a good listening for the ears.

    <i>Pascal van den Bos:</i> (co-composer, booklet commentary)

    Rowyn and i wanted to do a collab song for a while and here we finally got to it. This took a while to make (mainly because i wasnt hurrying up with my part oops) but we got it done so hell ye. I produced Rowyn’s part so it would fit better with mine, after that i started working on my part, i just tried to make another song that had a lot of leitmotifs in it. I was also really into Hotline Miami at the time so it has [[track:its-safe-now|some of that]] in it too. I’m also proud of the [[track:oppa-toby-style|Oppa Toby Style]] reference since i haven’t seen many songs that use that anywhere. As for the name uhh, it’s a horrible mess but it’s also kinda funny, one of the artists suggested it and we just kinda went with it?? yeah.

    <i>Rowyn Berlan:</i> (co-composer, booklet commentary)

    So as PB said we’ve been wanting to do a collab for a while and welp here it is. I started and finished my bit in a single day (which is rare as hell for me) because I decided to reference nothing but past songs by me and PBoss. Now I tried to use the most interesting parts from every song I referenced since my composition on some of the previously mentioned songs was extremely mediocre (and you can check em all out on the sound test... sadly). Now comes PB whose section completely blows what I had out of the water and shit I’m proud of him. Hope you enjoy! ([[artist:knil|Knil]] I both hate and love the fucking name you gave it)

    I had to make this song really quickly, my laptop killed itself for about two months before I could start work on this song. I actually barely finished within the deadline, and I’m grateful it’s complete (lol). This is probably one of my longest songs, kinda proud of it. Had to refrain from adding in a [[track:megalovania-ebhh|Megalovania]] reference in some parts, it’s always tempting when making songs in minor.

    The file wips were labelled as ‘when senpai breathes on my neck uwu’ the entire time I worked on this song. Thank [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|Pboss]] for that.

    I’ve wanted to remix [[track:an-orange-blue-rose|“An Orange Blue Rose”]] since i first heard it, and here i finally got around to doing so. I tried to make some sort of [[track:savior-of-the-waking-world|SOTWW]] style Orchestral remix of AOBR. I think it worked pretty well, i’m most proud of the intro which is a mix of epic bitcrush effects and a recording i made of the wind outside my house when they were burning stuff at an energy plant.

    <i>Rainy:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    Check the commentary for [[track:minuteman|“Minuteman”]] the full context, but this song is from an old solo album idea. Originally this song was going to have a bunch more references to Jane songs (I.E [[track:cyan-beast|Cyan Beast]], [[track:jane-dargason|Jane Dargason]], Etc), but I decided against this. The reason for this is that I felt like most of the songs I did for this album did not have enough of my own original composition and relied too heavily on references. So I decided to merge the references I had already planned with some original writing. I kept the references to [[track:first-steps|“First Steps”]] by David Ellis and added a reference to an unreleased song called [[track:crock-n-roll|Crock N’ Roll]] by RJ Lake. As my last song for the album, I’m pretty proud of this one and I hope you enjoy.

    I immediately fell in love with PotatoBoss’ song [[track:lust-stlap2|Lust]] as soon as he finished it. This is technically my third time messing with it and I’d consider it my best attempt lmao. After I showed pboss the WIP I had for the remix he came up with the idea of having the song be the prospit counterpart to Lust. I then went and added some sick piano cause john and some strings cause why not? In the end I’m happy with how it turned out but the original Lust is still better and you can’t convince me otherwise.

    <i>Rowyn Berlan:</i> (co-composer, booklet commentary)

    This song comes from a love of jrpgs and their music and I’m kinda sad I lost interest in finishing it... anyway, the story behind the creation of this song came from a spark of inspiration from octopath travelers soundtrack (if you haven’t played the game do yourself a favor and at least listen to the OST) and a thought I had regarding the denizens of homestuck. In short I wanted to make a strife theme for the denizens but as stated earlier I lost interest. Then there’s Rainy my savior, he told me that he wanted to finish the song for stlap 2 if there was room and I honestly love the direction he took the song.

    <i>Rainy:</i> (co-composer, booklet commentary)

    So I lied about Lifesaver being my last song stlap 2, sorry. Basically, when Rowyn said she could not finish the original demo of Beastly Skirmish, I decided to take upon myself and finish it. I liked what I had heard from that initial and thought it would be a shame for it not to get finished. At the time there were no more slots on the album, so I was gonna put the arrangement on ice until [[album:stlap3|STLaP 3]]. To cut a very long story short, we wound up needing and extra song and I was more than happy to oblige as it gave me an excuse finish this. I’m not quite sure if I captured the feel of the composition all that well, but I am somewhat happy with what I did for the arrangement. Despite what she might say, Rowyn is pretty good at music making.

    A while before i made this i asked [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit]] if he still has the disc scratches from a bunch of his songs. Later i noticed that these were also used in [[track:time-on-my-side|Time on My Side]] by Tensei, so since u had them i wanted to make a 16-bit cover of Time on My Side using the disc scratches. Just seemed like a fun idea.

    Based off of an excerpt from what I’d call a rather productive hour of me hitting a vibraphone repeatedly on a series of calculated whims for an hour and thirty minutes. None of it really felt forced, and I think I enjoyed making this track way more than I should have, for no reason whatsoever, though it was definitely also a *really* exhausting process. The ending bit is based off yet another vibraphone session which came *much* later, but in a nutshell I was just playing the same song, or at least what can be played with two hunan hands, when I got distracted and missed a note. Sounded nice, so I added it in.

    <i>apatheticPianist:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    So this song started out as a thing for an original, completely different album, then turned into a song about Grimdarkness in general, and now it’s a fight anthem for Grimdark Rose versus Bec Noir? And also probably some Vriska vs Bec Noir by the end, too, given how heroic-sounding and grandiose the ending gets... which probably means that “Of the Grim” also refers to how that’s a doomed timeline, and so definitely grim in a completely different sense? This was all definitely very intentional, and definitely not a complete coincidence.

    Either way, this’s probably the best song I’ve made so far and I’m super hyped to share it with y’all!

About ten days ago (lol) I said, "OK, let's go4it!" and gave it a shot. The result is something I have put off, like getting back into music. Thanks PotatoBoss, he's rad and a gracious manager to a [[group:the-paradox-music-team|bright group of musicians and artists]] I've been welcomed to create with. Homestuck takes me back and the ones who still love it pushed me forward <3.

    A lot of things were done for the 10th anniversary of Homestuck this year, one of them was the Homestuck Reanimate Project where a bunch of extremely talented artists came together to [reanimate the entire Collide Flash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdFdXOdfcrc). One of our artists, [[artist:sketchoodles|Sketchoodles]], was also [working on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEtC2WWffHI) and i decided to check it out. I ended up making this track for the credit sequence that would play after the animation. I also added it to this album because i wanted to officially release it on 4/13 as well. This is basically the track i made specifically to celebrate Homestuck’s 10th birthday, so thanks for being awesome, Homestuck.

    This song's commentary is going to get a little serious. After doing [[track:spritely-gardener|Spritely Gardener]], I wanted to do another song for the album. I had a bunch of stuff started but I just never had the energy to finish them. One of the ideas was a massive multi movement homestuck medley referencing all the beta kids' land theme. But like the other WIPs, I couldn't bring myself to work on it more. This went on until some time in early November. In November, I learned that [[artist:buzinkai|George Buzinkai]], Creator of homestuck songs like [[track:doctor|"Doctor"]] and [[track:endless-climb|"Endless Climb"]], had passed away. I was felt a profound sense of grief at her death. Some time passed, and I wanted to do something to commemorate her memory. So I decided to give my old project file another shot and that how "A Happy Ending" was created. I wanted to create something that embodied how much Homestuck and it's musicians meant to me. Is it perfect? No, it has a lot of issues and is overly long (Sorry [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|Pb]]). But I think it is something conveys the monumental impact that homestuck had on my life.

I of course say yes B) So we recorded it and i asked Rowyn if we needed a song for the background music, she said yes so i decided to remix [[track:passionate-duelists|Passionate Duelist]] from Yu-Gi-Oh.
