    <i>Ucklin:</i>
    [[artist:chesswanderlust-sama|Chesswanderlust]] did the very nice Bandcamp theme and header along with all the art for songs that didn't have track art yet a few days before release!

    [[artist:tee-vee|Tee-vee]] did a ton of work prooflistening / mastering the whole, very long album.

    [[artist:scorpyus|Scorpyus]], [[artist:gryotharian|Gryortharian]], [[artist:heir-of-puns|puns]], and [[artist:tipsy|Tipsygnostalgic]] really stepped up to help organize the album and give ideas when I (Ucklin) got super busy.

    [[artist:makin|Makin]] uploaded the album and came up with the name, as well as making sure all the details I forgot were taken care of!

    This one truly couldn't have come out without some new people stepping up and doing work on the team, and I appreciate it immensely!

Lyrics: |-
    A life without a goal<br>Sit down, wait for your call<br>If you're not dead by the time<br>You get to leave your hive
    Under pretty dresses and flower crowns<br>There's a fire waiting to burn inside
    Wasted time & wasted trolls<br>Enjoy your time before the fall<br>Sneak out of your sacred walls<br>Jade blood, black heart, ch-ch-cherrybomb<br>[mouth explosion sound]
    Our youth in nursery<br>Look how lucky we are<br>Drafted for chastity<br>For the rest of our lives<br>We're constantly brought down<br>There's no hope to be found<br>My whole life underground<br>It's ironic I find
    Under pretty dresses and flower crowns<br>Sick of this job of mom RP<br>Jade blood, black heart, ch-ch-cherrybomb
    No time to mope around<br>Let's try to break the cast<br>We'll fight the silent strife<br>Or go out in a blast
    Under pretty dresses and flower crowns<br>There's always a fire burning inside
    Wasted time & wasted trolls<br>Enjoy your time before the fall<br>Sneak out of your sacred walls<br>Take my tears, make it worth living<br>Hope lost right out of the womb<br>It's up to us not to succumb<br>No point in fighting to your doom<br>Jade blood, black heart, ch-ch-cherrybomb
