Lyrics: |-
    Howaitoboodo de hishimekiau
    Rakugaki jiyuu na negaigoto
    Houkago no chaimu yuuhi ni hibiite mo
    Yumemiru pawaa disurenai ne ainiku

    (<i>We jostle each other around the whiteboard
    Making graffiti of our free wishes
    Even if the after school chime echoes in the setting sun
    You can’t diss the power to dream, unfortunately</i>)

    Let’s sing motto motto motto koe takaku
    Kuchibiru ni kibou tazusaete
    Waado hanatsu sono tabi hikari ni naru
    Watashi-tachi no kakera

    (<i>Let’s sing with a louder, louder, louder voice
    Carry hope on your lips
    Every time when you release words, they turn into light
    They’re our pieces</i>)

    Omoide nante iranai yo
    Datte “ima” tsuyoku, fukaku aishiteru kara
    Omoide hitaru otona no you na kanbi na zeitaku
    Mada chotto…enryoshitai no

    (<i>I don’t need memories
    Because I firmly and deeply love “now”
    Getting immersed in my memories is a sweet, adult-like luxury
    But not yet…I want to hold back from it</i>)

    Kokoro no nooto maakaa hikimidarete
    Osareru to nakisou na pointo bakka
    Itami yorokobi minna to iru to
    Mugen no ribaavu de sasaru fushigi

    (<i>Drawing wildly with a marker in the notebook of my heart
    It only has points about how I feel like crying when I get pushed
    When I’m with everyone, pain and joy
    Stick in me with an infinite reverb, how strange</i>)

    Let’s fly zutto zutto zutto kanata made
    Kauntodaun matenai yabou oikaze ni
    Biito kizamu sono tabi purachina ni naru
    Watashi-tachi no tsubasa

    (<i>Let’s fly always, always, always to the yonder
    Our ambition can’t wait for the countdown in the tailwind
    Every time when I mark the beats, they turn platinum
    They’re our wings</i>)

    Yakusoku nante iranai yo
    Datte “ima” igai, dare mo ikirenai kara
    Yakusoku hoshigaru kodomo no you na mujaki na zeijaku
    Mou tokku ni…sotsugyoushita no

    (<i>I don’t need promises
    Because no one can live besides “now”
    Desiring promises is an innocent, child-like frailty
    I’ve already long since…graduated from it</i>)

    Itsu made mo doko made mo kitto kikoetsuzukeru
    Eien sae iranai no ni naze nakusesou ni nai
    Our Splendid Songs

    (<i>Forever, at any place, I’ll certainly keep listening
    Even though I don’t even need eternity, why can’t I seem to lose it?
    Our Splendid Songs</i>)

    Let’s sing motto motto motto koe karete mo
    Kuchibiru de kono toki tataete
    Ruuto onaji chizu mochi meguriaeta
    Watashi-tachi no kizuna

    (<i>Let’s sing more, more, more, even if our voices grow hoarse
    Praise this moment with your lips
    Having maps with the same routes, we were able to encounter each other
    It’s our bond</i>)

    NO, Thank You! Omoide nante iranai yo
    Datte “ima” tsuyoku, fukaku aishiteru kara
    Omoide hitaru otona no you na kanbi na zeitaku
    Mada chotto…enryoshitai no

    (<i>NO, Thank You! I don’t need memories
    Because I firmly and deeply love “now”
    Getting immersed in my memories is a sweet, adult-like luxury
    But not yet…I want to hold back from it</i>)

Lyrics: |-
    Bara no kubiwa tsunagete gin no kusari kuwaete
    Koyoi mo hitori hateru anata ga nikurashii
    Hizamazuite onameyo nigai ai no shizuku wo
    Tenshi ni hodokosu aoi DORESA-JYU

    (<i>Put on the collar of roses, and bite upon the silver chain
    Another one will die tonight - you are despicable
    Kneel down and lick the bitter drops of love
    A blue dressage performed for the Angels</i>)

    Jibun to iu hitsugi no naka kokoro wa mata ugoiteru
    Chigireta hane wa gekkou ni ikikaeri urumu wa
    Yami yori mo kowai no wa kodoku
    Futari no akashi jyuujika no moto de musabori mashou

    (<i>Within the casket called Myself, my soul yet moves
    Torn wings revive in the moonlight and grow wet
    More than darkness solitude is to be feared
    Under the Cross, let us indulge in the proof of our union</i>)

    Bara no tejou hazushite shiroi tekubi kasanete
    Fureau koto no kiseki anata ga itooshii
    Hizamazuite sasageyo itai ai no kotoba wa
    GA-ZE ni nijinda akai ARABESUKU

    (<i>Taking off the rose handcuffs, and holding each others Ewhite wrists
    It is the miracle of our embrace - you are beloved
    Kneel down and offer the painful words of love
    A red arabesque soaking the bandages</i>)

    Tsumidemo ii suki to itte kindan no kuchibiru wo

    (<i>Even if it's a sin, say that you love me with your forbidden lips</i>)

    Sekai wa sobietatsu oshiro GE-TO wo akeru no wa kami
    Sonna fuuni michibiki tsuzukete soshite watashi no me wo
    Susaidara dareyori yasashiku
    Namae wo yonde sonotoki shiru desho eien no imi wo

    (<i>The World is a looming castle, its gates opened by God
    In that way I will lead you, and if you fill up my eyes
    More gently than anyone call out my name
    When that happens you will know the meaning of eternity</i>)

    Bara no yubiwa majiete kawa no RIBON musunde
    Kagami no ma no butoukai subete ga kuruoshii
    Mayoikonde satoreyo meguru ai no rekishi wo
    Namida de kazarou kuroi MARIA-JYU

    (<i>Cross the rose rings and tie the leather ribbon
    It's a ball held in the Room of Mirrors - everything is maddening
    Go astray and be enlightened in the history of turning love
    A black marriage decorated with tears</i>)

    Uso de wa iya suki to itte jyunketsu no kuchibiru de

    (<i>I hate lies - tell me you love me with chaste lips</i>)

    Bara no kubiwa tsunagete gin no kusari kuwaete
    Koyoi mo hitori hateru anata ga nikurashii
    Hizamazuite onameyo nigai ai no shizuku wo

Lyrics: |-
    I remember you said long ago
    That I would be the star of your show
    In the end, though I see it was lies
    You've just come back to reclaim what's mine

    I've been working here patiently between the lines
    Creating perfection takes torment and time
    But never the less I've still been through it all
    And now they all see I'm a doll, face it

    Everywhere you look around it's my domain
    No one else deserves it more it's in my name
    And if you behave yourself I'll set you free
    It's clear, you belong to me

    Oh, don't you dare mistake me for another fool
    I'm the one who pulls the strings now you're my tool
    Don't you understand my little errand boy?
    Here you are only my toy, and you'll be mine

    A great creator once said it's much more art than science
    As long as you believe you only need the right appliance
    A bit of blessing and caressing with a lot of work
    And in due time my dears you all will see the perks

    Now understand who you're working for
    I'm up in heaven you're on the floor
    And soon you'll see I have much in store
    For you, it's less than a chore

    Now, don't you dare mistake me for another fool
    I'm the one who pulls the strings now you're my tool
    Don't you understand my little errand boy?
    Here you are only my toy, and you'll be mine

    I won't let myself be lead astray again
    I should have known better than to trust, a friend
    Blinded by the hopes of having dreams come true
    Now I know just what to do

    Let those vermin come to me just let them try
    I'm the angel everyone adores with pride
    Not even the devil now can take me down
    Infamy and fortune abound

    Don't you dare mistake me for another fool
    I'm the one who pulls the strings now you're my tool
    Don't you understand my little errand boy?
    Here you are only my toy, and you'll be

    You must be
    You'll trust me
    They'll all see
    It will be

    Mine

Lyrics: |-
    Je te revois me faire la promesse
    De faire de moi la star de ton show
    Finalement, rien n’était sincère
    Puisque tu m’as trahie aussitôt

    (<i>I remember you said long ago
    That I would be the star of your show
    In the end, though I see it was lies
    You've just come back to reclaim what's mine</i>)

    J’ai travaillé entre les cannalisations
    La perfection vient en y laissant des plumes
    Mais j’ai persisté sans une hésitation
    Jusqu’à être celle qu’on adule, vois-tu

    (<i>I've been working here patiently between the lines
    Creating perfection takes torment and time

    Tout ce qui nous entoure ici m’appartient
    Tout est à mon nom ça me revient de droit
    Si tu es sage je te libèrerai bien
    Mais sache que tu es à moi.

    (<i>Everywhere you look around it's my domain
    No one else deserves it more it's in my name

    Oh, ne te risque pas à te moquer de moi
    Je tire les ficelles dont tu es le pantin

    Un grand inventeur disait que c’est de l’art avant tout
    Tant que tu y crois tu n’as besoin que des bons instruments
    Un peu de chance, beaucoup d’amour et du travail surtout
    Vous en verrez le profit quand il sera temps

    (<i>A great creator once said it's much more art than science

    Reste à ta place tu travailles pour moi
    Je suis au paradis, toi sur terre
    Tout ce que je garde en stock pour toi
    N’est rien que tu ne saurais faire

    (<i>Now understand who you're working for

    Je ne me laisserai plus jamais avoir
    Je n’aurais pas du faire confiance à un ami
    Aveuglée par mes rêves et tous mes espoirs
    Je n’ai plus qu’une seule envie...

    (<i>I won't let myself be lead astray again
    I should have known better than to trust, a friend
    Blinded by the hopes of having dreams come true
    Now I know just what to do</i>)

    Lâche-tes vermines sur moi essaie pour voir
    Je suis l’ange aimé de tous quoi qu’il arrive
    Le diable lui-même ne saurait me déchoir
    L’infamie et la chance me suivent
