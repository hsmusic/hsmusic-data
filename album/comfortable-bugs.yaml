    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    <i>A very cozy effort (as the title implies). A combination of classic rock sounds of the 70's and some modern electronic tricks to create the mix-tape you always wanted to hear.</i>
    After spending part of the year doing a lot of different kinds music for commissions, I honed in and got personal on Comfortable Bugs. Flavors of Steely Dan, The Beach Boys, Roxy Music. I wanted the sounds time forgot.
    This an album for you and the stereo. Get comfortable.

Lyrics: |-
    It's been a long time
    It's been a long run
    I think I'm ready for some - a little
    Hard Reset

    This is a new day
    I've got a new job
    I've got to tell everyone about a
    Hard Reset

    Hard Reset
    Caught you on the rebound
    Hard Reset
    Caught you on the rebound

    I've got a new beat
    I'm so glad to have you on a

Lyrics: |-
    This train will make you feel pain, will make you feel pain
    Tick tock trains - running on the fumes now
    Turn it on, and how
    Got to get high get down get lost come round

    This yarn will make you burn barns, will make you burn barns
    Big black barns - quite iconoclastic
    How long will you last
    If you should trip the light fantastic

    And I'm not such an innocent kind of guy
    'Cause it all comes down to do or die
    So I won't pretend that I never get high

    69423
    Don't you blow your smoke on me

    This knot will get you caught, will get you caught
    Get your soul bought - keep it on the outside
    Take it on your stride
    'Cause you can't fall can't look can't run can't hide

    This brick will get you sick, will get you sick
    Just a big brick waiting in the windows
    Every good friend knows
    That once they're open they won't get closed

    And I'm not such an innocent kind of guy
    'Cause it all comes down to do or die
    So I won't pretend that I never get high

    69423
    Don't you blow your smoke on me
    I'm not crazy can't you see?
    This is where I wanna be

    69423
    More than just your fantasy
    Chain them up, don't set them free
    These bright stars belong to me

Lyrics: |-
    Now that you have joined the cause
    You act as though you're owed applause
    Is this your fight or are these bragging rights?

    Don't pretend you really care
    All you've changed is what you wear,
    What you say, and who you turn away

    You think you're bad (so bad)
    With the flag that you've been waving (so bad)
    With the world you think you're saving (so bad)
    Is it a fight that you are craving?
    Maybe it's just food

    Are you a bad enough dude
    To carry a torch, to ignite a feud
    To change the whole world when you change your mood
    It's hard to conclude
    Are you bad or just rude?

    Can you honestly afford
    To spend your life a sandwich board
    Your thick skin is only t-shirt thin

    Your enormous sense of pride
    Is just another place to hide
    Let it go - your life is not for show

    You think you're bad (so bad)
    With the people you've been taunting (so bad)
    And the message that you're flaunting (so bad)
    But is the change that you've been wanting
    All just attitude?

    Are you a bad enough dude
    To carry a torch - to ignite a feud
    To change the whole world when you change your mood
    If I might intrude
    I think you're just some prude

    You think you're bad (so bad)
    It could almost be inspiring (so bad)
    But from you it's only tiring (so bad)
    If it's attention you're desiring
    Maybe you're just screwed

    Are you a bad enough dude
    To carry a torch, to ignite a feud
    To change the whole world when you change your mood
    It's hard to conclude
    Are you bad or just rude?

Duration: '1:57'

Lyrics: |-
    Please forgive me - I was not privy
    The words I needed I'd not heeded
    Now I see that I've made a blunder
    I'm looking for a rock I can crawl under

    I've enforced such a needless course
    To a mindless goal that consumed my soul
    But now that I've been torn asunder
    I'm looking for a rock I can crawl under

    Don't ask why it took 'til now
    Cast your stones, I'll take my bow
    If you think you do no wrong
    Then you've been under your rock too long

    Judge me as you would judge yourselves
    We have all got skeletons on our shelves
    If we don't let them fossilize
    Our pet rocks will rule our lives

    Though it's an impediment
    I won't turn to sediment
    Before you bring your gavel down
    Look at the gravel all around

    (Wait a minute, we're getting ahead of ourselves here.)

Lyrics: |-
    We're comfortable bugs
    And we don't really care what we're giving away
    We live to laugh and love and play
    Each magical day

    We live in the rugs
    And the things that we need we keep close at hand
    So if you'd like to join our band
    You know that you can

    'Cause when you climb on the walls and hide in the trees
    It's so nice coming down, hanging round in on your knees
    In the comfort of friends with time you can spend
    Who you'll proudly defend from now 'til the end

    We're comfortable bugs living fun-loving lives in a wonderful world
    Not a care for tomorrow, no pain, no sorrow, just boys and girls
    We're comfortable bugs living fun-loving lives in a wonderful world
    Without a care at all

    We're comfortable bugs
    But we're not really sure quite which way to go
    So if you think you're in the know
    Come be in our show

    'Cause when you climb on the walls and hide in the trees
    It's so nice coming down, hanging round in on your knees
    In the comfort of friends with time you can spend
    Who you'll proudly defend from now 'til the end

    Say it again!

    We're comfortable bugs living fun-loving lives in a wonderful world
    Not a care for tomorrow, no pain, no sorrow, just boys and girls
    We're comfortable bugs living fun-loving lives in a wonderful world
    Without a care at all

Lyrics: |-
    All alone amongst the crowd a voice is in my head
    "Is there something I'm supposed to do?"
    Everybody laughing at the jokes I've never read
    Am I still a member of the crew

    Tuning to the rhythm of the music in the air
    Sounding out the words inside my mind
    The decoration fails to make me even care
    What was I supposed to find?

    I'm letting go
    Of the chances I had but was always gonna blow
    Of the beautiful people who never said hello
    Of the life I'd have lived if I knew then what I know

    Every night I sit and wait like something's gonna change
    I'll remember how to really smile
    The waves of time against my mind leave me deranged
    Can I make this worth the while?

    Your moves are fly but I'm a fly upon your wall
    Look in my eyes and make me real
    Teach me to dance when all the world's at the ball
    Give me something I can really feel

    I'm letting go
    Of the chances I had but was always gonna blow
    Of the beautiful people who never said hello
    Of the life I'd have lived if I knew then what I know
    Of the need to pretend that I'm living in a show
    Of the notion that I'd stay the same and never grow
    Of the great desperation to move against the flow
    Of all the errors I knew at the moment they were made
    Of the times that I left when I really should have stayed
    Of the secret inside that I'm still afraid

Lyrics: |-
    Say it isn't so hard to hear the things I have to say
    Say that I'm just a fool to think there's something in the way
    I can always call you
    I could never call you

    Say I won't have to wait for some occasion to arise
    Say the words I would say to you would come as no surprise
    I can never tell you
    I can only show you

    One small chance - One thin line
    No damn way I can conceive to say what's on my mind
    I love you - Three small words
    Just the dumbest thing I'm sure that you have ever heard
    Each time I try to call it feels absurd

    Say the truth deep inside your soul will only set you free
    Say this kind of exposure makes you just as scared as me
    I can hear my own voice
    Rehearsing-all-lone-voice

    Say if you saw me at my worst you would not turn away
    Say there's more to look forward to than wondering what to say
    Something I believe in
    I'd take such relief in

    One small chance - One thin line
    No damn way I can conceive to say what's on my mind
    I love you - Three small words
    Just the dumbest thing I'm sure that you have ever heard
    For now I guess the call remains deferred

Lyrics: |-
    If the air gets colder
    Would you care to smolder
    Here between my shoulders
    Underneath the skin of my disguise?

    When the music's playing
    What can be worth saying
    Yours will leave me praying
    Every time I look into your eyes

    For your own protection
    Mind your eyes' reflection
    Like a strange projection
    You will leave your subjects hypnotized

    Radiant and dangerous
    Though the act is painless
    I go nearly brainless
    Every time I look into your eyes

    Where do all of the walls go
    When you walk in the door
    You are the "and's" and the "also's"
    I am the "either" and "or"
    You look to me like an angel
    I took to you like a drug
    Bizarro heaven or strange hell
    We both were comfortable bugs

    Like a born romantic
    Mine are words pedantic
    Left to my own antics
    Nothing I have learned at all applies

    Things that I hold sacred
    Tenderly invaded
    I am nearly naked
    Every time I look into your eyes

    I can't remember the lies
    Why is it such a surprise?

Lyrics: |-
    Who do we know when we know who we are?
    Who do we play when we're playing our part?
    Why do we keep putting on disguises
    Clinging to the cheapest of surprises?

    Clothes make the man, but the man makes mistakes
    How to survive in a world full of fakes?
    Why do we repress our on affections
    Living by the code of our rejections?

    Is it always so damn hard
    To learn to be happy with who you are
    To roll with the puches
    Admit that our hunches
    Are the only truths we know?

    Why must our praise be indulged by a score?
    How can we love when we live like a whore?
    Where did we acquire these convictions
    Guided not by joy but our afflictions?

    Why call the gaffes when we're all making bluffs?
    Who says we're made of immutable stuff?
    Why do we keep burying the layers?
    Couldn't we admit we're only players?

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (Bowmantown Discord, excerpt, 9/27/2017)

    this is why I got into music

    For the mashups of my serious attempts to explain my soul with stupid shit from high school

    <i>LizaWithAZed:</i> (Bowmantown Discord, excerpt, 9/27/2017)

    I can't tell if you're joking or not

Lyrics: |-
    The light of Apollo rises and falls across the sky
    The cool of the evening slows your breathing to a sigh
    Lost in the lake house on the beaten path
    One broken camera snaps a photograph

    The pictures are gathered, gently slathered, fixed in place
    The walls of the gallery, climbing, towering into space
    Beckon you sweetly to forgotten sets
    One million memories in a stranger's net

    Another golden hour - a needle in the sea
    Another gift shop postcard - always close to me
    The light of Apollo flows through all we see

    The faraway beach this tour bus reaches melts away
    The thundering ocean casts erosion to the bay
    No trace at all outside my shadow box
    Printed and pinned up high behind the locks

    The dusk and the morning lull you, yawning, to your wrist
    The light and the shadows churn as paddles through the mist
    Life through a mirror might be forged of dreams
    Just one more snapshot rough along the seams

    Another golden hour - a needle in the sea
    Another gift shop postcard - always close to me
    A friend I don't remember - a place we used to go
    Someday it will heal us - someday they will show
    The light of Apollo flows through all we know
