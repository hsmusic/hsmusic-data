Lyrics: |-
    Nothing ever works out
    Nothing ever will
    There's not a place for you in this world
    That hasn't already been filled

    I guess you thought that
    It would just get better with time
    But your feelings didn't change
    You just pushed them deeper inside

    [You can't be happy

    Some way to tell you
    Some way to find
    Some way to reach you
    Outside my mind

    <i>Kalibration:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://kalibration.bandcamp.com/track/release))
    I could never hate you. Even in those worst days of my life, I never did.
    But my heart's no metronome. It can't swing in and out on time.
    I know now it's a lightning storm.

Track: Negative Space (demo)
Duration: '01:24'
Lyrics: |-
    Hard lines
    Divide us
    Soft lines
    Invite us

    Where one form ends
    Another begins
    Negative space
    Just never ends

    [I sought to sift the sands to seek to sell the self-help e-book
    I saw the shift to self to sing the song to sell the self
    To sleep and eat good

    I thought the thing today about the way we live and how
    It is evil
    I got the awful notion every little living thing
    Could be equal]

Track: Allergy Season (demo)
Duration: '01:52'
Lyrics: |-
    Springtime comes
    To other people's hearts
    But it's always winter in mine

    Heat and light
    In other people's hearts
    Why can't I catch fire in mine?

Track: 33 Days (demo)
Duration: '03:03'
Lyrics: |-
    Take my hand, I'll show you
    That this isn't a dream anymore
    You don't have to scream anymore

    All this could be yours
    I don't mind
    Take your time

    You said this would be simple
    I know it won't

    We could meet in your dreams, but
    I guess we won't
