Lyrics: |-
    (It's the same thing over again)

    And you're walking 'round the corner again
    It's the same thing over again

    But you've never seen that face before
    I swear on my life it's someone new I'm sure
    There's been nothing but the same for years
    But you have noticed something new right here

    But you're walking back home again
    It's the same thing over again

    But suddenly their face is right there
    By the side of the road
    Oh, you're losing your mind, they're beautiful
    How could someone like that end up out here
    Where there's nothing but the same for years

    Oh, but I am lonely
    In need of a friend
    I may never see a face like theirs again
    I will break routine
    And face my fears
    Or maybe I'll just stay right here

    And you're walking 'round the corner again
    It's the same thing over again

    Until I start to realize someone's waiting down the street
    It's the one I met, made me skip a beat
    Oh, they turned to me and said hello
    (That's not how I expected this one to go)

    But you're walking back home again
    It's the same thing over again

    But every day's a little bit different
    When you're looking for home
    Oh you've lost your way, you've begun to roam
    But a journey is better when it's done with two
    And I am honored to be lost with you

Lyrics: |-
    Woke up
    At the crack of dawn
    And set my sights on you
    No matter where this journey takes me
    I pray the winds will keep me true
    And I dont know where to go
    Whether sun or rain or snow
    But I know I'll always keep your memory by my side

    Sailed out
    Off into the coast
    To acheive my wildest dreams
    But without having you to guide me
    I wonder what it really means
    But I won't fret for too long
    Because I've always got your song
    And I know as long as I can hear your voice again

    I'll be fine

    We can make it to Atlantis if we try
    Fly across the sea, sail through the sky
    We can make it to the city down below
    We can go where only you and me know
    (Sinking slowly)

    I never thought that anything I'd ever say or do
    Would even have the chance to travel and find a way to get to you
    But even if I can still find you, I'm at a loss for what to say
    I feel my heart is slowly sinking
    As I watch you drift away

    Oh god, please save me from the mess that I've become
    I try my hardest not to break down but in the end my fear has won
    This is no way to sail the seas, this ain't a way that I can be
    If I'll ever have the hope to see your face again

    I swear I'll see your face again
    Before the end

    We can make it to Atlantis if we try
    Fly across the sea, sail through the sky
    We can make it to the city down below
    We can go where only you and me know
    (Sinking slowly)

    Oh, and these old seafarer's legs
    Are giving out under the weight
    Of everything that I have ever felt for you
    And I swear on Neptune's sea
    I'll find a way from you to me

    We can make it to Atlantis if we try
    Fly across the sea, sail through the sky
    We can make it to the city down below
    We can go where only you and me know

Lyrics: |-
    Oh my god, I am losing my mind
    If I could only take a moment then I'd maybe be fine
    But I can't catch a break when your thought is inside
    Every moment, every feeling that is filling my time
    If I tried to get away I'd be missing your thought
    And every feeling, every moment that your memory brought
    So instead I'll kill time by replaying your voice
    And I will sit back and be helpless 'cause I don't have a choice

    I am hopeless here
    My eyes the color of a rose
    Too far gone to care
    Falling down right now
    (Wish I could turn back time) I am hopeless here
    (A couple years or so) My eyes the color of a rose
    (I'd make myself less blue) Too far gone to care
    (And I could let you go) Falling down right now

    Oh my god, can you cut me a break?
    Like just the thought of being with you leaves me lying awake
    And insomnia's a bitch when you're falling in love
    But maybe I'm a drama queen because I think it's enough
    I swear to god I am doing all I can
    To try to function like a normal human being once again
    But I think you ruined me with the light inside your eyes
    Your delicate smile, oh, you've got me hypnotized (no lie)

    I am hopeless here
    My eyes the color of a rose
    Too far gone to care
    Falling down right now
    (Wish I could turn back time) I am hopeless here
    (A couple years or so) My eyes the color of a rose
    (I'd make myself less blue) Too far gone to care
    (And I could let you go) Falling down right now

    (Wish I could turn back time)
    (A couple years or so)
    (I'd make myself less blue)
    (And I could let you go)

    I kinda wish I had excuses here to say
    But they all ditched me in this island and they're drifting far away
    My eyes are getting heavy and my consciousness is thin
    But because I'm fucking stubborn that by head's not giving in
    (Whats the point?)
    Oh, I don't even even care anymore
    (What's the point?)
    Oh man, I wish I had the answer long ago
    (What's the point?)
    Maybe I just like holding on to something
    That I have had a chance if I was brighter than before

    (Wish I could turn back time) I am hopeless here
    (A couple years or so) My eyes the color of a rose
    (I'd make myself less blue) Too far gone to care
    (And I could let you go) Falling down right now
    (Wish I could turn back time) I am hopeless here
    (A couple years or so) My eyes the color of a rose
    (I'd make myself less blue) Too far gone to care
    (And I could let you go) Falling down right now

    (Wish I could turn back time)
    (A couple years or so)
    (I'd make myself less blue)
    (And I could let you go)

Lyrics: |-
    I saw a comment here the other day
    I've thought a lot about the things that people say
    You said you like the composition but the vocals arent great
    "Turn the autotune off, like jeez, you can't do 808s again (I swear to god)"

    But I guess that you know better than I do
    Maybe I'm not great at writing my own tunes
    So I lay here in defeat all black and blue
    Never noticed that there's too much autotune

    And I'm sorry my stuff is too boring
    There's not enough melody, godawful writing
    Oh, and I'm weary to sing my words freely
    Theres far too much autotune, god, I'm so sorry
    Oh, and I'm a sucker for when my synths flutter
    I use the same turnaround in all my choruses
    "God, you're so tired," and yet I keep lying
    I use too much autotune and I'm not sorry

    I read an argument the other day
    They say that pop musicians cheat to sound okay
    And blame the downfall of humanity on Cher and Antares
    "It's dishonest and fake, so maybe learn to fucking sing"

    But I guess that you know better than I do
    Maybe you could go and write some better tunes
    *Me laughing like an idiot asshole instead of actually singing the lyrics I wrote*
    I kinda noticed that I use too much autotune

    And I'm sorry my music ain't trendy
    I guess I lost track of a genre or fifty
    And oh, "these synths are boring, your melodies iffy"
    I use too much autotune, god, I'm so sorry
    Oh, and I'm a sucker for when my fans suffer
    So I will write lyrics about how I hate them
    "It's sad if not inspiring how hard that she's trying"
    I use too much autotune and I'm not sorry

    But I guess that I will never be that cool
    So I'll sing and dance and paint myself the fool
    And I'll be fake so I can be more true
    And I'll keep on using too much autotune

    (Sorry, I guess)

    But I guess that all is fair in war and peace
    And I dont really care if you might disagree
    So I'll do me and I'll let you do you
    And I'll keep on using too much autotune

Lyrics: |-
    It's a special day today
    I'm setting time aside to pray
    That maybe things might change a bit this year
    But I'm a fool for having dreams
    Or at least that's what it seems
    Since I'm on the outside looking in at you

    I wonder why I never got that lovin' for myself
    Is it because I made you mad or brought you down?
    I don't know why I've never had that lovin' for myself
    I'm just a mess sometimes, I'm sorry if I've ever let you down

    Oh, I can see
    Why I may feel so lonely
    I'm trying to make do without you

    Spending special days alone
    Wishing you were here
    We're all just spending special days alone
    And I am praying for the day
    When I can look to you and say
    "My love, I am so glad to be with you"

    It's another special day
    And yet again alone I stay
    It seems my luck is always running out
    But maybe I deserve this mess
    God knows I am not the best
    Yeah, I'm slowly losing my own peace of mind

    I wonder why I never got that lovin' for myself
    Is it because I'm always insecure and sad?
    I don't know why I've never had that lovin' for myself
    I'm just a lonely little mess and maybe I just bring you down

    It can't be true
    That I'm not good enough for you
    I think I'm way too hard on myself

    Spending special days alone
    Wishing you were here
    We're all just spending special days alone
    And I am praying for the day
    When I can confidently say
    I'm deeply, endlessly in love with you

    And I have fallen to my knees
    To beg myself, to air my pleas
    I won't let loneliness destroy me!

    I'm a mess
    My seams are bursting, I confess
    But maybe I could spend the day with you?

    Spending special days alone
    Wishing you were here
    We're all just spending special days alone
    But now it all seems clear
    I'll never spend another day alone!
    And I am praying for the day
    That I don't have to hide away
    And I can live my life next to you
    And I am praying for the day
    When I can look to you and say
    "My love, I am so glad to be with you"

Lyrics: |-
    Two windmills in the distance
    I stop to find my thoughts
    I wish that you could see this
    But I guess you'd rather not

    I stare in naive wonder
    My mind drifts back to you
    I hope that you might miss me
    I wish that you would miss me

    Fall in love again with me, Amélie
    So many answers, babe, I think that you're the key
    Fall in love again with me, Amélie
    You miss that new relationships
    But maybe fall in love again with me

    I cook an egg with a spoon!

    (Thanks!)

Lyrics: |-
    Staring down the edge of a cliff
    Wondering what things we have in store
    This ain't the first time you've been lost in this place
    Breaking down my oceanic door
    The wind picks up as you're starting to leave
    I know what's on your mind as you wake up
    'Cause the figure in the distance sees the gleam in your eyes
    I guess that you've just ran right out of luck
    Because

    I don't think we're going to last
    This love is built on sand and glass
    You're broken and unusual
    I'm nothing but a dream
    But love's about what we may doubt
    Impossibilities
    So you'll love me near and dearly
    And I'll be your secret girlfriend

    Next time we meet it's a school
    Floating through the air from hall to hall
    I guess that you just like to torture yourself
    Chasing down imaginary gals
    I can't blame you for disdaining it all
    (If I was real too I'd always sleep)
    But I guess if you're determined then you're shit out of luck
    Cause everyone wakes up eventually
    Unless...?

    I don't think we're going to last
    This love is built on sand and glass
    You're broken and unusual
    I'm nothing but a dream
    But love's about what we may doubt
    Impossibilities
    So you'll love me near and dearly
    And I'll be your secret girlfriend
    (Is this real or is it a dream?)
    (Does it even really matter?)
    (Is this real or is it a dream?)
    (Does it even really matter?)

    Maybe you can be with me still
    But that would take impossible will
    If you're asleep forever, your life will be a dream
    Then maybe in eternal rest you'll always be with me
    (Is this real or is it a dream?)
    (Does it even really matter?)
    (Is this real or is it a dream?)
    (Does it even really matter?)

    I guess this plan is falling apart
    I won't exist if you stop your heart
    We should've thought this through but now it's all fading away
    But if you die I'm by your side just listen to me say
    Can you please keep a secret?
    Do you think you'll keep this secret?
    Will this always be a secret?
    We're both nothing but a secret

    Every time I think of you
    I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
    It's no problem of mine, but it's a problem I find
    Leaving a life that I can't leave behind
    But theres no sense in telling me
    The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
    But that's the way that it goes, and it's what nobody knows
    Every day my confusion grows

    Every time I see you falling
    I get down on my knees and pray
    Waiting for that final moment
    You say the words that I can't say

    I feel fine and I feel good
    I'm feeling like I never should
    Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
    Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?
    I'm not sure what this could mean
    I don't think you're what you seem
    I do admit to myself that if I heard someone else
    Then I'll just never see just what we're meant to be

    Every time I see you falling
    I get down on my knees and pray
    Waiting for that final moment
    You say the words that I can't say
    Every time I see you falling
    I get down on my knees and pray
    Waiting for that final moment
    You say the words that I can't say

Lyrics: |-
    But this will pass
    The good will come, the bad will never last
    So let your tears flow out so you can fill your glass
    And it will leave
    So take your heart and wear it on your sleeve
    There's nothing there to lose, so calm yourself and breathe

    "But sometimes it's too hard"
    She said to me today
    In such defeated ways, her glass is emptying
    "I am just a fool"
    So bitter, so unwound
    Her silence made such sound as she unraveled here
    "That's why I'm giving up"
    But don't you give up yet
    Your worries and regrets are still a part of you
    "There's not a thing that I can do"
    It's true
    Maybe it's not black and white
    'Cause you've got grey inside
    So bad and good will stay forever in a balance game

    But this will pass
    The good will come, the bad will never last
    So let your tears flow out so you can fill your glass
    And it will leave
    So take your heart and wear it on your sleeve
    There's nothing there to lose, so calm yourself and breathe

    "I guess that's just that"
    We sat there in a daze
    As hours became days
    We almost lost ourselves
    "What's the fucking point"
    These things are hard to know
    When you can never show
    And it's inside of you
    "And that's why I'm giving up"
    Half empty or half full
    There isn't any rule
    It's more like half and half
    "Oh, will my story ever last"
    So when you're feeling down
    You'll surely soon rebound
    And everything is in its place so things will be okay

    But this will pass
    The good will come, the bad will never last
    So let your tears flow out so you can fill your glass
    And it will leave
    So take your heart and wear it on your sleeve
    There's nothing there to lose, so calm yourself and breathe

    But this will pass
    The good will come, the bad will never last
    So let your tears flow out so you can fill your glass
    And it will leave
    So take your heart and wear it on your sleeve
    There's nothing there to lose, so calm yourself and breathe

Lyrics: |-
    I stand before the castle doors
    On a quest to save my love
    Now I'm not that great, but still we wait
    For a message from above
    And I consider why I'm here
    And everything ive ever feared
    But I will risk it all to heed the call
    And save who I hold near

    As time ticks on I sing my song
    Praying I'll hold you again
    As the trumpets blare, I stop and stare
    For the king will now begin
    My blade is soaring high, as his decree says it is I
    I am the one to save my love
    Beloved princess I shall come!

    ("That sounds silly...")

    Your honor, your majesty
    Won't you please be with me?
    I swear on my life I'll make it worth the while
    (Never anything less than free)
    Oh, your honor, your majesty
    Consider what I plea
    I swear on my dignity, my pride, my joy
    (I'll be the best me I can be)

    I kneel before my grace, my liege
    I swear my blade to thee
    Though I'm on my own again for now
    I'll serve my kindgom faithfully
    And if I never come home again
    Just know I'll be dying for your privilege
    I'll keep your family name alive
    I will serve my queen with pride

    As the seasons change with time
    I begin to miss the home I left
    To protect our brightest light
    But I can never let fear set in
    I will make our kingdom win
    And anybody with an outlook darker than the black of the night
    I'll be with you to help you make it right!

    Your honor, your majesty
    Won't you please be with me?
    I swear on my life I'll make it worth the while
    (Never anything less than free)
    Oh, your honor, your majesty
    Consider what I plea
    I swear on my dignity, my pride, my joy
    (I'll be the best me I can be)

    Now I'm not the kind to mope and whine
    When I have a job to do
    But I miss your face, your warm embrace
    I am aimless without you
    But I know work is what I need
    To save my princess, bride-to-be
    I'll always fight to do whats right
    I will serve you, be your knight!

    Your honor, your majesty
    Won't you please be with me?
    I swear on my life I'll make it worth the while
    (Never anything less than free)
    Oh, your honor, your majesty
    Consider what I plea
    I swear on my dignity, my pride, my joy

Lyrics: |-
    There's not a care in the world when I am here
    A precious secret only for your ears
    You'll know it when you begin to see
    The leaves and grass are losing all their green
    (And then you'll hear it)

    Roaring silence as the song begins
    Blazing starlight when the drums come in

    Here it's autumn every day!

    There's not a thing that can get to us in here
    Oasis as the equinox draws near
    (And then you'll hear it)

    Luminescence is surrounding me
    Light the world and let your worries free

    Here it's autumn every day!

    Sometimes I'm still afraid of you (I'm losing you)
    As leaves touch ground, my heart is turning blue (My heart turns blue)
    September comes, I'm all alone (It's all my own)
    But maybe theres my winter still unknown (The great unknown)

    I guess that we'll just have to see

    Here it's autumn every day!

    And I guess that there's a reason that you'd stick around so long
    I don't think it's a coincidence I've wrote so many songs
    And even if I'm kinda foolish or a bit too insecure
    I know I'll always be your special baby girl
    (That's right)

    Hold me tightly, love
    I'll keep you safe right here
    Kiss me gently, love
    You'll never have to fear
    Hold me tightly, love
    I'll keep you safe right here
    Kiss me gently, love
    You'll never have to fear

    I was so lost back in December
    But January gave me you
    And then in April we're together
    I can't believe it all came true

    I was praying for forever that I'd never be alone
    Count my blessings on the daily 'cause I let my fears be known
    Now I'm falling down forever, deep in love I will remain
    Aand my life will never ever be the same (I won't complain!)

    Hold me tightly, love
    I'll keep you safe right here
    Kiss me gently, love
    You'll never have to fear
    Hold me tightly, love
    I'll keep you safe right here
    Kiss me gently, love
    You'll never have to fear

    And now it's almost January
    I'm thinking back upon the year
    I think that I have found my purpose
    I finally feel like I am here

    And your help and your support are why I'm standing here today
    So if it means I'll make you happy I will sing my heart away
    God, I love you, I adore you, you're the light inside my life
    And I hope someday that I'll make you my-

    ("No, like, li- I'll, like, write you a song or something.")

    Hold me tightly, love
    I'll keep you safe right here
    Kiss me gently, love
    You'll never have to fear
    Hold me tightly, love
    I'll keep you safe right here
    Kiss me gently, love
    You'll never have to fear
    Hold me tightly, love
    I'll keep you safe right here
    Kiss me gently, love
    You'll never have to fear
    Hold me tightly, love
    I'll keep you safe right here
    Kiss me gently, love
    You'll never have to fear

Lyrics: |-
    Staring down the edge of a cliff
    Wondering what things we have in store
    This ain't the first time you've been lost in this place
    Breaking down my oceanic door
    The wind picks up as you're starting to leave
    I know what's on your mind as you wake up
    'Cause the figure in the distance sees the gleam in your eyes
    I guess that you've just ran right out of luck
    Because

    I don't think we're going to last
    This love is built on sand and glass
    You're broken and unusual
    I'm nothing but a dream
    But love's about what we may doubt
    Impossibilities
    So you'll love me near and dearly
    And I'll be your secret girlfriend

    Next time we meet it's a school
    Floating through the air from hall to hall
    I guess that you just like to torture yourself
    Chasing down imaginary gals
    I can't blame you for disdaining it all
    (If I was real too I'd always sleep)
    But I guess if you're determined then you're shit out of luck
    Cause everyone wakes up eventually
    Unless...?

    I don't think we're going to last
    This love is built on sand and glass
    You're broken and unusual
    I'm nothing but a dream
    But love's about what we may doubt
    Impossibilities
    So you'll love me near and dearly
    And I'll be your secret girlfriend
    (Is this real or is it a dream?)
    (Does it even really matter?)
    (Is this real or is it a dream?)
    (Does it even really matter?)

    Maybe you can be with me still
    But that would take impossible will
    If you're asleep forever, your life will be a dream
    Then maybe in eternal rest you'll always be with me
    (Is this real or is it a dream?)
    (Does it even really matter?)
    (Is this real or is it a dream?)
    (Does it even really matter?)

    I guess this plan is falling apart
    I won't exist if you stop your heart
    We should've thought this through but now it's all fading away
    But if you die I'm by your side just listen to me say
    Can you please keep a secret?
    Do you think you'll keep this secret?
    Will this always be a secret?
    We're both nothing but a secret
