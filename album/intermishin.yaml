    <i>Ephemerald:</i> (Cover Artist)
    This is by far the most complicated piece of art I've done for the team yet. Since the album itself is split into two halves about both the Felt and Midnight Crew, I wanted both parties to have equal representation on the cover. (I was planning on having Vrasky/Snowman included, but it was really hard to find space for her - everyone's super close together as is! So I settled on having her hat/horns resting on the piano.) An idea quickly sprang forth - the entire Felt, staring in horror at the shitty Midnight Crew. The Midnight Crew's poses and positions in this cover mimic how they looked on [[album:midnight-crew-drawing-dead|Drawing Dead]] (plus blush on the cheeks!). Since I've had a couple people ask - none of this is ripped from Homestuck. I drew all of it myself! I did use a ton of reference though, from the aforementioned album cover and images on the wiki. The background is based off of the Felt Manor's first appearance in the CANWC intermission. All the colors are adapted from The Inaugural Death of Mister Seven. Originally, the entire Felt was supposed to be monochromatic, but after some people told me to change up the color scheme, I realized that this effect made everything kinda pop, and look a lot more unique. I'm really proud of this piece! I hope you enjoy it, and I hope you enjoy everyone else's contributions to this album! I know I do.

    licord nacrasty always seemed to me like a fitting theme for some corrupted version of the Midnight Crew. Now that that's an actual thing I quickly took the opportunity to make a disk jingle out of it. Then people proceeded to do much more interesting songs with it but this is still a thing that happened I guess.

    <i>Shadok:</i> (Artist)
    I actually made this early during the intermishin, so i kept updating it everytime something happened to the characters.

    I don't like this. It's boring and the bass isn't tuned properly. I made this so long ago that I have no idea what was going through my head at the time. what time signature is this? according to the FL project file it's in 4/3 but that sounds stupid and wrong.

    Originally [[artist:pipko-fanfare|dC]] made this as a DVS-font-swap of WANO called "We are [[group:toby-fox|Toby Fox]]" but didn't have any lyrics ideas; I suggested making an intermishin song out of it and did a rewrite of the canon lyrics in a few minutes. Turned out pretty well, since you can't exactly go wrong with DVS sax.

    This song has a clear story. Theres a clock, and spades h\*cks it up. Then it restarts a little wonky, and spades h*kes it up some more. Rinse and repeat. Time signatures used: 4/4, 15/8, and 23/16. (and 13/8 for the end). Samples used: that one page where Slick hecks up a clock in HS, and The Broken Clock by Jit.

    <i>Wheals:</i> (Composer)
    This is an ancient idea I had, dating all the way back to the days of [[album:cool-and-new-voulem1|voulem. 1]] when I made an HB song -- I wanted to make a song for every member of the MC, then finally a song that used all four previous. The intermishin album provided the best possible motivation to actually get down and do this. I'm not super happy with the song honestly, but it was something I felt I had to make to complete the plan I made all the way back.

    <i>Austinado:</i> (Artist)
    this piece really speaks volumes of its intense creation process, i did it in like half an hour with two cans of Mtn Dew Code Redâ„¢ and an inspiration to not only put every important item and person in the intermishin on these pictures, but to also run out of ideas and put bart simpson on it instead of something else

    Everyone else made character themes or random original compositions for this album but I suck at both of those. I still wanted to contribute to this album so I decided to arrange an existing song in jazz style. It's not exactly intermishin related but Fresh Jimmy is a free pass for everything and I'm fairly happy with the end result.

    <i>Scarodactyl:</i> (Artist)
    When cookiefonster mentioned the track's title this image immediately came to mind.  The song might not have anything to do with Michael Jackson, but that Jimmy is one Fresh Criminal.

    I had an idea for a Knife Party based Spades Slick song a while ago, but I scrapped it because i couldnt really think of where to go with it. However, I did have this other random piece that I was working on that was Walk-Stab-Walk but the â€˜drumsâ€™ were those weird ASMR noises from Rain from [[album:medium|Medium]]. At some point I realized I could just combine the two, and this song was born. Actually Iâ€™m really happy with how this turned out, I only wish I could have thought of an excuse to use Internet Friends samples. Special thanks to Bob for making my original track art idea look good.

    <i>SplitSuns:</i> (Composer)
    I actually started production on this song before the idea for Intermishin developed. Someone had an idea to mash up Liquid Negrocity and We Are Number One, and I jumped at the opportunity after realizing how similar the chord progressions were. Originally this was going to go on a later album, but after realizing that this was originally a [[album:midnight-crew-drawing-dead|Drawing Dead]] song I decided to move it to this release. I wanted it to begin in a similar way to my first song "[[track:the-endless-black-aka-clockwork-negrocity|The Endless Black]]" before quickly diving off the rails into pure insanity. I wanted the song itself to have the instrumentation of WANO with the bass and piano providing the Black-bone, if you will (and I certainly shall.) Robbie's distinctive voice tied the whole thing together, and I had a lot of fun chopping and echoing it up throughout the song. To break up the main idea, I put in a Ballad of Jack Noir-esque tune near the end that I think really helped charge the song with some energy. And of course, it ends in a big finish before fading out in the same way as Liquid Negrocity. This track was pretty complicated to produce, but I think it turned out very well in the end in terms of balance!
    Fun fact: there's a reference to [[artist:silvagunner|Siiva's]] first WANO rip in the song. I wonder if you can spot it...?

    <i>Ephemerald:</i> (Artist)
    The basic idea here is pretty simple - combine Spades Sleck and Robbie Rotten to get utter hell. The background is meant to invoke the first panel of the Intermishin - you can see the gateways, the flame, the shitty rug, and a clock throughout the image. At first I just wanted to draw a hyperrealistic version of Sleck's shitty head, but along the way that turned into making his head be a reasonable facsimilie of Robbie's own head. I also modeled Sleck's knife off of the knife he wields very early on, but tried to make it look three-dimensional, once again attempting to convey a hyperrealistic shitty drawing. I made this track art before the album cover, and looking back, those principles are clearly echoed in it as well. The Midnight Crew's lines look pretty much as clean as the Felt because of how "hyperrealistically shitty" I went, so I had to go back and .jpeg them up a bit. I didn't do that with this because... I'm lazy??

    In many ways midnight suffer was a really Jack Noir feeling song, so I decided to remix/remaster it so that it sounded much more improved. Fittingly the intermishin album idea came into fruitition while I was just finishing the remaster so luckily I had a song for the MC side. I am fairly happy with how it sounds. It took me ages to get the mixing right, and even then I still think certain parts of the song could be improved. Nonetheless I had fun making it and I hope you enjoy it!

    "Do we really need a jingle for a section that consists of a single song?" you might ask. Well, if you have to ask, that's just proof you're just insufficiently cool and new.

    I always appreciate a chance to do some semi-live piano work, and I love flare!!!!!!! So here's a thing that riffs on their shared chord progression, leading into Dif's rather more in-depth exploration of the subject.

    <i>tempest2k:</i> (Composer)
    One day I guess I decided to stop being shit at music. I don't remember what inspired me to make this, but I really wanted to try using different instruments and take advantage of certain patterns. I am a bit stubborn when it comes to making music, as most of what I compose I try to make without referencing motifs, so I wanted to make my own. Something catchy and, more importantly, GOOD. I made something good, but it was short, and Felt (pun entirely intended) like an introductory track. That's when Difarem swooped in and asked for a midi of the song, which he then turned into something AMAZING. All of the motifs you hear in this song aside from the original ~30 seconds of the song were all added by him, and I have to say they were added quite masterfully. I had once planned to make this be the first of a set of tracks for every member of the Felt, but I only ended up making around 5 or 6 tracks. Most of them were garbage, so you aren't missing out on much.

    <i>Difarem:</i> (Arranger)
    Haven't got really much to add to what [[artist:tempest2k|Roxe]] said, but I'm pretty proud of how this track turned out! Some parts could be still worked on, though, and I'm a bit ehhhh about the instrumentation. Oh, and bonus: I self-plagiarized at one point.

    This is very much a track leftover from a collab album myself and the esteemed [[artist:double-hats-eyewear|DHE]] were working on, but I still like it. It's very slow, very minimalisitic. It also sucks ass, but that's beside the point, y'know?

    Fun fact: Taking a great song in 13/8 and converting it to 4/4 makes it way less interesting! Still, this was good practice at making more convincing orchestral parts and working with articulations and other little performance nuances.

    Rarely has a work of fiction ever had so great an impact on our culture as Moby Dick. Even amongst those amongst us who have the misforunate of being born outside the United States it is considered a cultural landmark. A significant portion of praise for the novel is for the characterisation of its... Deuteragonist, or antagonist, or something else? Just mentioning Captain Ahab summons a vision of unstoppable, furious vengeance. On every page of the novel his anger and hatred for the white whale burns. [[artist:cecily-renns|JohnJRenns]] serves a similar function to the whale in the Homestuck fanmusic community, being an unholy and incomprehensible terror that we all flee at the name off. Of course, the novel would not be complete without copious referencing to the most famous novel of \*that* era, namely Homestuck by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Some even consider the character of the white whale to be loosely based off the character of Sawbuck from the earlier Homestuck, both being huge masses of blubber which show little to no indication of intelligence. This piece of music was composed to represent the slow, onerous march of Sawbuck, unstoppable, his forward progression inevitable, no wounds slowing him down. Under any circumstances, do not attempt to attack Sawbuck, for this *will* backfire. Could you face off in a head-to-head against this time-bending monstrosity? Killing him is no walk in the park, it's safe to say.

    So this song was made as a more of an album ender, incorporating (rather just editing together) songs from the album into one. Its mostly taking inspiration from [[track:variations|Variations]] which was the album ender in the original [[album:the-felt|Felt album]]. Before this, I was going to make a [[track:jade-dragon|Jade Dragon]]-type song, but halfway through it started to take too long so I scrapped it. There's still a snippet in the song though, at the end, so it didn't go to waste. Maybe I'll finish it one day and it'll be the best thing you have ever fucking heard idk

    <i>Makin:</i> (Seer)
    This does reference the song "jaed dargon" by [[artist:kobacat]], which has not been released as of 2023.

    I quite literally lose my shit over anything intermission related so I had the time of my life drawing this track art. While I canâ€™t give an exact number, I can say this piece took me around 15+ hours. I experimented a lot with the lineart as I lined with a brush I was fairly inexperienced with. I chose a brush which emulated inking as I felt it made the characters look much more eye-catching. I also felt it made the entire image itself look harsher which I believe reflects the rather rough nature of the intermishin (and intermission) pretty well. I probably enjoyed drawing Vaska (Vrasky?Vaksaks? Snowmom?) the most and admittedly took inspiration from manga when lining and shading her hair. I overlaid the image with a texture and applied a lot of saturation to finish this piece off as I wanted the end result to look kind of like an old vinyl cover. Overall, I am very very happy with how this turned out!

    I wanted to make a really omnious super serious track for the Felt album. This song was actually made as an idea for the Felt manor but I eventually decided it would be a good theme for Scratch (or O I think) considering the clock sounds, the reversed ostinato and the serious swinging beat I totally didn't sample from another website. All in all it sounds good, it's brief enough to give you an insight into a character we haven't met yet, and it in some ways foreshadows something to possibly come.

    Started off as a sad, lamenting song. Some of the melody sound like English so I thought "PUT IT IN D-MINOR!" I also wanted to try emulating the idea of "He is already here" so I hid the motif of the last four notes throughout the song.
