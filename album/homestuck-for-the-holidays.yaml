    <i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20101230063632/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/), excerpt)

    WHOA HEY. Check it out. A bunch of guys from the music team put together a sweet Christmas album at breakneck speed! It's quite great, and *virtually* free. They're giving all the proceeds to charity. NICE JOB DUDES.

    <i>Lexxy:</i> (cover artist, [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/lexxercise/art/Homestuck-for-the-Holidays-190909696))

    FINALLY! The delicious fruit of my all-day drawing marathon.

    The music team put together a free* holiday album as a thank-you to the MSPA community and asked if I would donate a cover illustration! It was unfortunately rushed, and is just BEGGING for me to keep working on it, but I already made them wait all day and couldn't justify continuing to be a terrible person.

    I had the privilege of listening to it in advance and it is an excellent compilation. So download it and be jolly!

    Happy Holidays, everyone!

    Homestuck and its characters belong to [[artist:andrew-hussie]].

    *Apparently bandcamp has limited free downloads, which have already been exceeded! Fortunately, all proceeds go to Child's Play! So the meager amount you shell out for this is for a very good cause.

Lyrics: >-
    (Heya kiddos, it's your old pal, George the Conductor. Gather 'round, it's time
    for a story. Now and again, every single year, millions of Earth babies are born.
    But only one of the years that there has been in all of history has had a baby
    born who, inside of him, has had all the powers of a higher deity. It is on this
    god-child's birthday that everyone, more or less, will gather around with their
    families and buy expensive things for people they love dearly. Now, we in the
    Incipisphere celebrate Christmas too, oh no no no don't get me wrong, we love
    Christmas. But our Christmasses are a little bit different. You see, our Christmas
    time festivities don't have a-a Frosty o-or a Rudolph, because we don't accept
    the Christmas apocrypha as canonical, and we don't own radios because of how poor
    we are. So we don't know what a Frank Sinatra or-or a Bing Crosby is. But if you
    point your ears at the sky and listen, real real careful, on Christmas morning,
    you might just hear us Skaians singing our Christmas Carol.)

    (Now you may start thinking to yourself, isn't it only people that celebrate Christmas?
    That's where I'd have to stop ya. And say, Christmas doesn't end with just people,
    it's species all over the world. Now I know a couple of 'em that live right under
    the sea. I think you know. I think I do too. And I think that they've got something
    they need to do.)

Lyrics: |-
    I forgot to buy my last christmas gift
    The most important one of all
    And if my past record is any indication
    Then this is the last slip before the fall

    I'm alone, not where I want to be
    The only company I have is me
    I'm sleeping in another bed tonight
    In the space behind the candlelight

Lyrics: |-
    The snow is at our door now and I put on great boots
    It's time to shovel all this conksuck frozen soup

    When I'm finished with this I will put up all the lights
    And Hella Jeff and Sweet Bro will measure all the heights

    And fall into-
    Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll be your Mister Claus
    And we'll fade away on Christmas day
    In a jpeg compression loss

    Geromy and Peaches
    They're putting trimmings on the tree
    The star is meters off the ground
    How high does it have to be

    Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll be your Mister Claus
    And we'll fade away on Christmas day
    In a jpeg compression loss

    Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll- Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll- Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll- Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll- Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll- Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll- Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll- Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll- Shit, let's be Santa
    I'll be your Mister Claus
    And we'll fade away on Christmas day

Lyrics: |-
    (Alright alright, it sounds like you have a lot of work ahead of ya. Take care, Bro and Jeff! And so, we close on a very special celebration, of a very very special time of year. But don't you young'ins be fooled, oh no no. Christmas never really ends. In fact, it's only about 365 days left until the next big day! And in Santa time, that's only a few seconds. So kids, be good, and maybe next year Santa will bring you something extra special in the name of that magic infant from the very first year of modern days. And don't forget about us up here in the Incipisphere either, because children, we're always here to help. We're always looking out for you!)

    (Oh, it's time to get back to work! I hope you enjoyed the stories. Merry Christmas, and a happy, happy New Year, from your old pal, George the Conductor.)

    (I-is that it? Are we good? Is-did I get the line? Alright, okay.) (God.) (When's lunch?) (God damn.)
