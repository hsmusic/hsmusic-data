    <i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>
    Remix album of "[[Doctor]]" by [[artist:buzinkai|George Buzinkai]]

    George Buzinkai wrote unique, memorable pieces such as [[Endless Climb]] and the aforementioned Doctor for Homestuck. She's an inspiration to all fan musicians such as us, and without his melodies spreading throughout the Homestuck discography - with 30 tracks containing the Doctor melody as a whole - Homestuck wouldn't be the same without her.

    Lately, Buzinkai's life situation hasn't been very good, to put it in blunt terms. To say the least, she is not in a situation where she can produce more music for our ears to behold to. And without our help, she might be stuck that way.

    So if Doctor, or any of Buzinkai's contributions for that matter, has ever passed through your eardrums (possibly resulting in a permanent eargasm), ~~please consider supporting [[album:qualia|her upcoming album]]. Thank you.~~ 

    UPDATE: Since the release of this album, George Buzinkai has passed away. They were an inspiration to all of us and will be sorely missed. Rest In Peace, George.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Bin:</i>
    For the longest time, I've felt that the track "Doctor", featured as track number 37 on the album "Homestuck Vol. 1-4" has gone unfairly unnoticed by the majority of Homestuckies and Buzinkai fans alike. Inspiration struck one day, and I decided to give this hidden gem some love. In a creative fervor, I threw open Audacity and sampled a heart rate monitor, musical senses coming to life as I pitched each individual beep. I was on a roll at this point, and a second wave of inspiration hit me where I least expected it. I pulled out my microphone and poured my soul into every voiceclip, the spirit of doctors everywhere flowing through me. With my newly acquired "medical license", I performed invasive surgery on the track, in a manner of speaking, and ended up with something I was more or less happy with. I'm pretty sure the song is only like twenty seconds long, so it wasn't really that hard, but I'm still proud of the achievement. On a side note, Buzinkai actually intentionally made the song to sound like a heart rate monitor, as he revealed in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsG71P_zEIE">explanation thing</a>, but I didn't know this until a few days after I made the track. I found that to be a funny coincidence.

    Anyway, this song took me around ten minutes to make, so I hope you enjoy it.

    I was struggling with trying to find a good song to mashup with Doctor for the album and I decided to try one of the tracks from Black Mesa Source. I tried a few that didn't really quite work out, but finally managed to settle with mashing it up with Lambda Core from BM:S. The song had a pretty similar tempo and it didn't come across as too different from Doctor so it worked pretty well. Considering I was hoping on making a non-shitty mashup (which will be up to you if it's a shitty mashup of two songs or not), I think this worked pretty well as making a decent and sort-of serious track for the album, and I'm glad I was able to mashup a song from one of my favorite games for the album.

    <i>No Funny Name:</i>
    So. It's been a month. I've been living in a reclused part of China without any internet access. For the longest time I couldn't stand the thought of coming back to the community tha I let down, but I decided last week that was no way to live so I came back. I was surprised when I came back to civilisation and found literally singles of supportive messages from fans and fellow music team members. I don't think I have confidence in myself yet I can't stress how important those two messages are to me. Especially the one from someone on the music team. It contained software that allows even the most untalented person to make good sounding music.

    Anyway I arrived back around a day before these songs have to be released and apparently this album is doctor themed? I don't know what this song is so I just searched for "The Doctor Song" and made a remix of that as I'm not confident enough to make anything original yet. Hope you enjoy.

    <i>Wheals:</i>
    The idea for a Flintstones rip of Doctor was originally by Difarem, but he got busy and coudn't get around to working on the song in time. By that point, though, the art had already been made and it was just too perfect to leave unused. So I loaded up the PXTone project Difarem made (really, he did the hard part of the work here) and threw in some Grand Dad at various points and voices. PXTone is a pretty cool program, though I think I still prefer DAWs where the text on instrument names/labels is actually readable

    <i>MrCheeze:</i>
    Over the years, I've seen a lot of people notice the melodic similarity beween Doctor, and the original cross-examination theme from Phoenix Wright. The Moderato version of this track was my first attempt at combining the themes, and is pretty much just a Doctor midi with the melody swapped out for the Phoenix Wright one, played back in a midi-to-chiptune converter. In my defense, I actually made this one years ago, more out of curiosity to what it would sound like than anything.

    <i>Bambosh:</i>
    Now, when I saw an Ace Attorney styled track I just knew i had to create something for that. It was a long and grueling process, but overall I'm pumped about how my piece of shit scribbling turned out. Another valuable lesson I learned was that Photoshop's pen tool is an unholy abomination and should burn in a fire. You know that dream you have when your dog runs across the street in front of a car and you call out to it but it doesn't stop running because dogs are adorably dumb sacks of shit? And you wish you could have done something to stop it running in that clearly bad direction but it just kept going anyway? That's what the pen tool in photoshop is like.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Wheals:</i>
    The idea for this track dates more or less back to the beginning of the idea of an all-Doctor album. With heavy inspiration from the awesome [[track:can-you-give-me-a-hand|can you give me a HAND]], I decided to try out a combo of [[track:savior-of-the-waking-world|SotWW]] + the [[track:rollercoaster-tycoon-theme|RCT theme]]. After transposing the 4/4 RCT melody in the aforementioned song, from a MIDI [[artist:pipko-fanfare|dragonChaser]] kindly provided me, to E♭ minor (let's face it, [[group:toby-fox|Toby]] is the absolute madman), I had some help from [[artist:mrcheeze|MrCheeze]] and dC tweaking the rhythm so it matched SotWW a little better. [[artist:cecily-renns|JohnJRenns]] was a big help in getting the bass and drums to sound passable, though it was Makin's suggestion to use Doctor for the melody in the bass in the part where the piano comes in. The project became a lot more fun once I let it turn into a real remix, rather than an attempt to recreate something as complicated as the original -- I never appreciated just how much is going on during the main middle section of the song before. Anyways, I think it turned out pretty well for my first real remix (as opposed to an Audacity mashup).

    The song was originally called Slower of the Coasting Roll, but I realized that throwing in Slow your roll memes would make the song a little sillier than I was going for. Getting rid of that also let the name almost rhyme with the original name.

    <i>olkiswerve:</i>
    I only really jumped in near the end to add my special flavor of GIMP stupidity to the mix. I worked on "[[track:gee-its-another-doctor|Not Another Doctor Remix]]", "[[track:moondoctor-moonsong|Moondoctor]]" (the cave story one) and "Savior of the Coasting Rolled". All three were fairly simple image manips and were pretty fun to do, although it took me way too long to do them. Special thanks to whoever completely fucked the formatting on this document. I'm on mobile and it took me 10 minutes just to set it fucking straight again. Fuck you <3

    Join us next time where I will talk about dilbert3, cool ranch, and clown suicide. Probably.

    <i>Noisemaker:</i>
    When I usually make my tracks, I almost always either use the MIDI file for the song I want to remix, or I just come up with a new melody altogether. There's a couple of cases, however, where I deviate from the regular formula and do something completely different. In this case, it was V a p o r w a v e (well, not quite). Honestly, this might one of my favorite ways to make music right now: I import the original song into FL Studio, pitch it up or down, and add some crazy effects to it. What you hear at the beginning of the track is a combination of Fruity Squeeze and Gross Beat on the original track, which are automated to decrease and eventually turn off after the first few measures. While I only have 1 track on this album, I had a lot of fun being a part of this project. Thanks to every single one of you who happened to take the time out of their day to download this!

    TL;DR: how to making music is first step wrap bum around dik

    The idea was make only a Hospital-game themed Doctor Remix. But actually i remembered Theme Hospital. Later looking from game's OST i just found a song called "Doctor" in his OST. So i decided to do a Double doctor mashup. A funny thing is this game reminds me of a hospital tycoon game. *insert i don't like [[artist:silvagunner|siivagunner]] joke here*

    <i>MrCheeze:</i>
    Not gonna lie, the only reason for this track existing is because of how ridiculous the name would sound. But [[track:doctor-remix|Doctor Remix]] is such a weird, experimental song to begin with that I really had no idea how I could possibly do a remix of it... so I just took the easy way out, throwing it in the wub machine and calling it a day. The end result is about as easy on the ears as the original Doctor Remix is, at least.

    <i>XenoZane:</i>
    I wanted to make some really rad DJ are to reflect how sicknasty this beat was, yo. I snagged myself up some dank-ass pictures of gnarly DJing, skateboarding, and surfing and shit. I got slick-ass tubular sound bar things and a wub machine logo.

Anyways, I got the idea for this track when I screwed around with my friend's  acoustic guitar and thought it sounded decent. The bass works really well with the main melody surprisingly, making for a"meh"/10 piece. Also, :jaedAngery: is the best emote and there is nothing you can say to disagree with me.

    I didn't know what medicus meant so I looked it up and apparently it was Roman and they have statues so I put the definition, some Roman statues and some doctors.

Lyrics: |-
    The power of love is a curious thing
    Make a one man weep, make another man sing
    Change a hawk to a little white dove
    More than a feeling, that's the power of love

    Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
    Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
    Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
    Power of love that keeps you home at night

    You don't need money, don't take fame
    Don't need no credit card to ride this train
    It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
    But it might just save your life
    That's the power of love

    (When this baby hits 88 miles per hour—)
    (1.21 jigowatts?!)

    I was bored at work one day when I realized that Doctor and English probably would sound nice together. I decided to make it into a track, and was going to call it 'Doc English'. But then I started thinking about time travel, and the name 'Doc Brown' came to me. The Back to the Future sections of the song developed from there, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned up.

    Oh Diet Dr Pepper is the flavor that I savor
    It's sweet and spicy, totally unique
    It makes me want to sing this song about my soft drink saviour
    That brings me joy when everything looks bleak

    Oh Diet Dr Pepper by the can or by the twenty
    I drink them morning, afternoon, and night
    It's got no fat or calories but taste it has aplenty
    Beats cola, root beer, juice, and even Sprite

    There can just be only one true Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Loyal subjects, me and you, to Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Death to every other drink but Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Because they just really stink but Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper

    I'll show you to a brand new world of Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Our banner flies proudly unfurled for Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Lay waste to all the other drinks it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Satisfying all my kinks it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper

    (Don't kinkyshame me plz.)

    Oh Diet Dr Pepper raise the flag of revolution
    And murder every soft drink in your way
    Your perfect taste has led me to a new Final Solution
    Kill everyone, start with a brand new day

    And as the dawn rises anew on Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    The drink of choice for me and you, it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Taste like this just can't be beat, oh Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
    Pepsi lies dead in the street, it's Dr Pepper, Dr Pepper
Commentary: |-
    <i>Pipko Fanfare:</i>
    This is one of those rare times where as soon as I had the idea, most of the details came rushing into my mind on how I wanted it to go. Which is great, because it makes the process way easier! Despite this, lyrics are still hard. I think the biggest challenge was keeping it recognizable as a "doctor" remix despite the completely different chord progression, melody, etc, but in the end I feel like I pulled it off about as well as I reasonably could have. Fun fact: I finally bought a pop filter for my microphone after doing this and [[track:dr-doctor-phd|Dr. Doctor, PhD]], so while there's <b>P</b>lenty of <b>P</b>losives in this one, if I ever dare to sing again it should sound better next time. (Well, the singing would still be bad, but the recording would be better!)

    I was going to pretend that I'm actually capable of singing better than this but was just imitating [[artist:scott-stutzman|Stutzman]], but we all know that's a lie.

    Hah, I don't even know what to say. My original intention was to create a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wss5kuL2zro">This video contains win</a>" YTP styled Doctor remix. I'd like to think I succeeded to some degree. Inspiration strukc in the form of tha <a href="">Sonic 25th anniversary Livestream</a>, the annoying buzzing noise ever present giving me a second instrument. After that, I figured since I had included the Sonic 2 era cartoon and the present day sonic, I should include something from the Dreamcast era, hence the Robotnik/Obama conversation.

    "Fun" fact, I made this entire thing with a non-functional right earphone. If it sounds off, try disabling your right earphone so that you get the intended experience.

    One day I asked the chat for ideas on another Doctor remix, and several people threw ideas at me. I deftly avoided all these ideas and decided to make a dance track instead. The name was inspired by [[track:doctoral-degree|Doctoral Degree]] by [[artist:difarem|Difarem]] from [[album:cool-and-new-voulem1|Volume 1]], since that was a dancey Doctor and this is basically a dancey [[track:savior-of-the-waking-world|Savior of the Waking World]], I named it after what one would do after earning their doctorate.

    <i>BitesizeBird:</i>
    So, basically, I wanted to make at least one song for the album. I wanted to make something unique in some aspect and since I can hardly compose something original, Doctor played by heart monitors seemed to be reach my shitpost standards. The track was underwhelming though so to add to the scene of a patient on their deathbed, I added the background arguments from a sound effects website. It was really fucking funny to me so I left it at that. Shitpost done. I didn't realize [[artist:bin|Bin]] essentially did the same thing with [[track:orderly|Orderly]] until writing this commentary, so my fault for being a lazy git and not listening to other people's songs first.
    I was going to add a doctor reading the time of death at the end of the song (being 7:20) but it seemed forced and I couldn't be bothered to do it.

    <i>MrCheeze:</i>
    Now the Allegro version of this track is more interesting. Whereas [[track:cross-planetary-exploration-moderato-2016|Moderato]] was an approximate recreation of Doctor with the [[artist:ace-attorney|PW:AA]] melody substituted in, this one is the other way around. Moreover, this track is actually a modification of an exact rip of the cross-examination theme, extracted right from the game. Sounds much better that way, don't you think?

    (Also, if you were looking for pointless facts - both CPE Moderato and CPE Allegro actually combine Doctor with the Allegro version of the cross-examination theme, so one of their titles is a bit of a lie.)

    Tracing over the Cross Examination face thing that happens was incredibly taxing process, since my bowl of pasta was in the way of the drawing tablet as I was trying to wrangle my hand into doing the goddamn things I tell it to do.

    <i>Pipko Fanfare:</i>
    My first completely serious track for Cool and New, this one exists only because MEME NUMBERS (and I'm glad that it does!) I did 4 songs for [[album:cool-and-new-voulem1|Vol 1]] and [[track:err-on-greif-acoostic-covre|1 song for Vol 2/II]], so naturally I had to do 3 for this volume to complete the mythical 413. You may also notice that all three of my tracks on this one have lengths that are permutations of 413 just to take it that extra mile (including awkwardly cutting off [[track:dr-doctor-phd|Dr. Doctor]] mid-phrase to force it to fit!)

    By this point I had used up the low hanging fruit with Dr. Doctor and [[track:dr-pepper|Dr. Pepper]], so my original thought was to do a cover with mostly or entirely real instruments. I already had done a cover using nothing but bass guitar back before CaN was a thing, and I figures I could expand that into something bigger. Obviously that's not what ended up happening here at all! This song went through a lot of changes as I was making it, and the final product bears pretty much zero resemblance to anything I was imagining at the start. There are still quite a few real instruments - the acoustic and electric guitars, as well as the bass guitar are all live recordings. But everything else is synths, soundfonts, and VSTis. Even the name wasn't decided until the track was totally complete - it was just "doctor 3.rpp" on my computer until it was done and I realized that some [[track:savior-of-the-waking-world|Savior of the Waking World]] and [[Penumbra Phantasm]] had snuck in. After using up all my creativity on the track itself, none was left for the title, and so this shitty name is what we get to live with. Oh well.

    I'm also getting REALLY sick of Doctor...

No biggy i basically just rip everything of the quality midis by [[artist:mrcheeze|MR.CHEEZE]]. mUsescore is also great at syncing midi together because you can just copy and paste. But back then i didn't know much about EQ and instrumentation so i just do it and only care about the chords and melody . Now i knew about all of those but im lazy so i didn't fix much.THANKS

    On one bright summer morning in mid-to-late july, our JohnJRenns was whistling a tune. That tune is a mysterious number that is repeated aplenty that happens to be [[track:bowmans-credit-score|seven hundred and twenty]] I mean [[track:do-you-remem8er-me|Do You Remem8ber Me]] by [[artist:malcolm-brown|Malcolm Brown]].

    I like that song, I said to myself. Man, I want to remix this song, I said. I wonder how good it will sound with Doctor, I said. man let's throw in some fucking [[track:oppa-toby-style|Oppa Toby Style]] in as well.

    So was formed the first version of Do You Remember the Doctor. Then I showed it to people. Then Tirantbacon, AKA Music God Probably Maybe, told me he had some Problems™ with it. So he told me to give him the .flp file for the song. So I did. Then he did, um, whatever a Music God Probably Maybe does, and made this thing, which made the song infinitely better overall. So basically it's his song at this point. And I'm proud of him. <img src="media/misc/JaedHapy.png" width="24">

    <i>XenoZane:</i>
    I was inspired by this brilliant masterpiece of a song to make some amazing track art worthy of its greatness. As the song was bounds and leaps ahead of all music to date, the art had to be just as mind-boggling. I immediately got to work. A long, grueling Google search late I found the perfect stock image. The four doctors standing there in their assorted outfits spoke to me in the same way the song did when I first heard it. [[track:rose-pragnant|I came as fast as I could.]] I threw the picture right into GIMP and got to work. After a bit of resizing I started customizing it. Getting a picture for Doctor was easy, it had track art. The other 4 were harder. They were all on [[album:homestuck-vol-5|volume 5]], so I had to make my own pictures for them. Plague Doctor was the easiest of those 4, I just found a plague doctor mask and put it on him. As for Medical Emergency and Savior of the Waking World, I used the pictures [[artist:luminantaegis|luminantAegis]] used in their extensions. I was able to find a descend picture pretty easily. After brainstorming for hours I was able to think of FOUR WHOLE DIFFERENT WAYS to agree. When it came to putting descend in, I realized I had no stock image for it! I had to scroll through miles of Google Images just to find the perfect picture. When I did, the sensation was amazing. I felt a rush of dopamine as i threw the picture into GIMP. I resized it to the corner and started masking the Descend image. The whole thing was looking fine until i realized the big empty gap in the bottom left corner! I quickly got to work thinking of potential things to put there. After a week and several garbage bins full of crumpled paper, I finally came to the obvious conclusion. Just put the title there.

Lyrics: |-
    I told the world, one day I would pay it back
    Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
    So that one day I could play it back
    But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
    Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
    Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
    When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
    But they don't know what dope is
    And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
    All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
    You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
    But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
    But it just dawned on me you lost a son
    Demons fightin' you, it's dark
    Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
    I don't think you realize what you mean to me
    Not the slightest clue
    'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
    You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
    Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
    There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

    I'm about to lose my mind
    You've been gone for so long
    I'm runnin' out of time
    I need a doctor, call me a doctor
    I need a doctor, doctor
    To bring me back to life

    It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
    You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
    'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
    But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
    Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
    Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
    Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
    Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
    I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
    It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
    Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
    You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
    Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
    Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
    You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
    But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
    But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
    Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
    Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

    I'm about to lose my mind
    You've been gone for so long
    I'm runnin' out of time
    I need a doctor, call me a doctor
    I need a doctor, doctor
    To bring me back to life
    Bring me back to life
    Bring me back to life
    I need a doctor, doctor
    To bring me back to life

    We were in a big hurry to have art for the Doctor Remix album finished, and as many people as possible had to participate and throw in art, even if it sucks. So I drew this piece of crap art on MS Paint. See also the track art for [[track:witch-doctor|Witch Doctor]].

    <i>Griever:</i>
    This wasn't very good. Probably one of my worst songs, and you'll be seeing a lot better in later albums. Spoilers, there's more. They're not even that ironic, really. At least this song is a joke about how Octopimp left, but then I used lines that weren't even voiced by Octopimp anyways. So...yeah. Look, just read Jojostuck.

I thinked "What would be a nice [[flash:3297|[S] Wake]] reference that is not Vriska or Jack?" Welp. Feferi cut in two. I just changed Feferi for John. Changing head and skin colour and the dress colour. (Yeah. John with a Dress.) Actually i like it so much. *insert [[track:gangnam-style|gangnam style]] or triple q joke here*

    It was a rushed song to finish the album with meme numbers and also ruins from JKDFJKundertale i my favorite song. It has a very unique melody and there are no specific chords for it so i put it with doctor and it turns out as i expected. But then i rememebr there is a song called Ruins from JKDSJKVol 5 homestuck too and i just put it there. It doesnt stand out as much but its still pretty fine. It was really late and i was quite tired so i just rip the drums from asdfjasHero's End (Cave Story) and put it in. Nice and neat. It was fun after all. The second part i thought was boring to just put in the same first part so i added Lotus from vol 5 also.

    <i>Interrobang:</i>
    I made this the day that songs for Volume 5 were due, when we thought we were one or two songs short from 52 tracks, 52 being a prime CANWC music team M E M E N U M B E R. So, I threw this together in Musescore by abusing [[artist:mrcheeze|MrCheeze's]] Doctor MIDI, and then took it to Audacity to do the panning. The plugin used for that was 'Random Panning', which can be found on the Audacity Wiki under 'Nyquist Plugins'. I highly recommend it.

    <i>bobthetacocat:</i>
    So it all started when a few people were asking about who on the team could create glitch art. After I metaphorically raised my hand, we started throwing up ideas for a potential [[track:doctor-remix-remix|Doctor Remix Remix]] cover art (which never happened.)

    Eventually, interrobang came up to me and asked if i could make Doctor glitch art. I accepted, and after some mumbo jumbo that no one cares about and some pixel sorting, I had a widescreen glitched picture of Doctor. I then put it into a cinematic framing, where the picture stands now.

    (Oh my God, I hate Garageband so much.) (i came as fast as i could)
Commentary: |-
    <i>Discfortune:</i>
    I've been meaning to get at something deeper with my music. After much deliberation, I decided to funnel all of my efforts into i need an ambulance!!.mp3 in order to express a statement that I think resonates with all of us—Mortality. I think it's important to recognize that our time here on Earth is very limited and that it can be ripped from us in an instant. As you can see from the eight measure of the song, which clearly references René Magritte's "The Human Condition", I've chosen to greatly emphasize the notion of joy as well. Another thing to keep in mind is the odor of the piece: An earthy aroma paired with a metallic ring. This is very much intentional, as it links the two themes I have mentioned in a sort of harmonic matrimony rarely seen in daily life.

    Let's discuss the process of creating this work. Crucial to the progression of the song was deciding how to link the sections before and after the bridge portion (which served as a cheeky allusion to the 50 Shades series). I had tried out several options including a reverse phonograph output drive and a theremin turned upside-down before settling on a much more humble choice. You can hear the results for yourself. However, perhaps the greatest hurdle to overcome was deciding on what colors to use for the instrument tracks. To this day I am uncertain if I have chosen correctly.

    The few instances where the listener may catch glimpses of the track titled Doctor were added in the interests of "spicing up" the tracklist. this is a running theme throughout the album.

    This piece was recorded with a live orchestra. You can reach them here: itsthenewyeah.com
