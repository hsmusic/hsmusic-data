    <i>Makin:</i>
    Ok I don't know how we're gonna format this but I want to thank Gryotharian and Monckat for doing an absolutely amazing job getting track art done for every remaining track in like, a week. That's 26 and 17 arts respectively! They can be said unironically to have saved the art part of this album.
    The other artists are fine too but they didn't make 17 track arts and that's the cutoff for being personally mentioned...
    <i>Ucklin:</i>
    Thanks: Circlejourney and Makin for helping with management and organization, Kanishka for working a lot to get the booklet ready, Gryotharian for giving feedback to almost every song on the spreadsheet, and everyone else on the team who took on roles to help us get this out in addition to their music and art contributions! Also, everyone who tuned in to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz6uitzoTgU">the livestream</a>.
    I thought this would definitely be our final album going in, but now I don't feel so sure. It really was a team effort, so thank you everyone!

    <i>WarxTron:</i>
    A Skaia song originally made for Haeldral's Felt Mansion 2. One of the two final Homestuck songs I made. I wanted it to sound pretty but epic like Skaia itself but without using the same [[Skies of Skaia]] leitmotif as always.
    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    Skaia has such pretty colours, I wanted to capture that.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Discfortune:</i>
    I made this track in 2017, during high school. Now I'm about to graduate from college. Isn't that surprising? Time flies.
    Spacetime Starstriker was also the second track of its original release platform. It was first published through a different music team (am I allowed to name CANMT here?). At the time, I think I was mainly excited about the track's aggressive time signature changes.
    Over the years, I've assembled a laundry list of things I'd change in the piece if I were to start again from scratch. But I'm still proud of the original product, and grateful for the reception thus far. I feel content with this being my last major contribution to the HS fanmusic space. For the time being.
    Many of the motifs and quotes in this track are lifted from CANMT tracks. What a fun group! Those folks helped me get into music-making in the first place, and I most certainly would not be here without them. I encourage you to check out some of the more experimental albums we released. They're more interesting to me than the Greatest Hits compilations, anyhow.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    I held a poll among friends for the title of this song, but I couldn't pick a favorite even after the results were in so i just tried to mash all of them into one title. It worked... alright. The original plan for the song was just going to be a straightforward beatdown remix, but I liked what I made too much to relegate it to that, and also really wanted to reference [[album:the-baby-is-you|The Baby Is You]], so thus was born this shitpost of a song.
    I hope the art reflects that energy too. I've been told I have a particular talent for ironically bad masterpieces.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Tee-vee:</i>
    Originally named "Nepcafé", ideas for this song came from wondering how the cat sample from Mario Paint Composer would fare as a funny resonant acid 303 style sound, and puns with "Net" and "Nep". At some point I was reminded of rave and scene aesthetic Nepeta headcanons/AUs etc, loved that and thought it was the best track to riff off from that ! Even though I was inspired by Nepeta I think it could very much fit Meulin as well, it's a very Leijon track in my mind.

    This one I actually wrote a while ago. At this point I was just challenging myself to make as many homestuck covers in as many different styles as I could and I think this one is particularly special. Squiddles were already one of my favorite little lore spirals from homestuck so to be able to put a little bit more AU weirdness is something Im honored to be able to do.

    A track about Jade before SBURB, when she was just a girl playing with her (teleporting space) dog. Jade's story always captivated me—the way her life was idyllic, lonely, triumphant and tragic in turns. It's one of my favourite parts of Homestuck, and I wanted to pay her a little tribute. I included her theme instruments, the flute and bass, as well as howling SFX in reference to Bec. Many thanks to [[artist:funk-mclovin|FunkMcLovin]] for playing trumpet on the track.

    <i>Makin:</i> (album management)
    As always, Astro Kid manages to turn any track into a rave-worthy bop, no matter how melancholic the original is. This used to be a lost track, and I might have never heard it if Rafe Saltman hadn't reuploaded it on Youtube, so he deserves our thanks. This art piece was actually inspired by the track a few months after it was made, so I contacted the artist to finally make it official, half a decade later.

    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    Upon Makin's suggestion, someone needed to make the art for this Rose pondering her orb. And that someone was me. I like to think she does this regularly. Has a special room in her house just for Orb Pondering. And Kanaya just has to deal with it.

    <i>Scorpyus:</i>
    I did my best to capture the dreamy feeling of the moons with the slightly sinister undertones. Originally started out as [[Prospit Dreamers|"Prospit Dreamer"]] funnily enough, but then I added the [[Atomyk Ebonpyre]] motif and I decided it might fit better as just a track for both the moons.
    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    I originally had very different art in mind for this track, but every time I heard it, it made me think of someone falling through the center of Derse. The use of the [[Atomyk Ebonpyre]] motif decided that that person would be Dave, and while it didn't really end up being the center of the planet, I feel like I captured the vibe well enough.

This is that but LOWAS, and also taking 20 minutes to render a frame instead of whatever fps the old screensaver ran at. The cost of beauty. It's an honor to make art for a LOFAM album, I've been listening to the older ones since I was a teenager. You could say that with this art I fulfilled a Pipe Dream.

    I made this track for the [[group:canmt|Cool and New Music Team]] [[album:intermishin|Felt/Midnight Crew album]] circa 2018 or so, and it was nominated for "the next LOFAM" long before any actual prep for this album had really started. I actually requested it be taken off of LOFAM5 because I felt it didn't meet my standards anymore, but due to a miscommunication it stayed on. I found this out about 15 minutes before the release stream, which is happening as I type this - Album is sounding great, y'all! Anyway, hope it sounds better to you than it does to me.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    This is a really weird one for me. Originally, I started out with the intention to do a remastered and updated version of my track "[[The Puppetmaster]]" from our previous release [[album:friendsymphony|Friendsymphony]], but slowly, I came to realize that the remaster kind of sucked, and all traces of it were eventually wiped from this track. The intro (can you call it in intro if it's more than half the song?) came to me about half a year after the main body of the song, it was the first thing I ever recorded vocals for, and may well be the last. Not much point in putting lyrics down though, cause all they are is "ooOOOOooo". I was listening to a lot of Colin Stetson's music during the time I made it so that probably played some influence in it. Then another half year after that I replaced the main body of the song too, because after listening to it with fresh ears, it was kind of a discordant mess. I kept the original idea behind [[The Puppetmaster]], a distorted mix of [[WORST END|Worst End]] and [[English]], but that's about it. I might release that version eventually, but it won't be on this album.
    This was some of the first non-pixel digital art I ever did, and for that, I think it turned out pretty well. However, I had a real knack for doing things the hardest possible way, and oh my god, I never want to draw another clock again. I did all of this, with a keyboard and trackpad, on a free trial for a photoshop knockoff. That wallpaper? I didn't figure out how to use the copy-paste tool properly, and had to manually put in every detail on it. This was a nightmare to complete, (albeit a nightmare of my own making), so you all had better appreciate it.

    I was surprised by how fast everyone loved this track. I think this is the only one that I didn't have to make any edits to after submitting it, and it's one of my oldest submissions too, I made this well over a year ago. Very briefly, it was going to be a Vriska and Eridan track, using all different instruments, but it wasn't working well, and as soon as I switched it to the piano samples, the rest of the song just basically created itself, becoming a whole new vibe that was very The Felt, and not at all Vriska and Eridan.

    A track vaguely themed around Dave, Rose, Derse, and the lovely eldritch horrors next door. For the most part it emerged from wanting to remix some lesser-utilized themes such as [[Switchback]], [[Ace of Trump]], and [[At The Price of Oblivion]]
    Rose and Dave chilling on Derse, with some horrorterrors looming above. (I've taken some artistic liberties with the horrorterrors, in being conjoined into a single mass they kinda resemble the horrorterrors in my fanventure [The Tapestry](https://mspfa.com/?s=21688&p=1) more than canon Homestuck ones)

    The Wayward Vagabond seems to have stumbled across the ruins of the NYC Skaianet Headquarters. And it seems there's an enticing, delicious green light inside. Will we ever see what he finds in there? (well none of this is officially canon, so probably not)

    Inspired by the short cover of [[Science Seahorse|science seahorse]] from [[Rainbow Rumpus Partytown|the medley]] tee-vee did some time ago (go check it out if you haven't already), I just wanted to try and do a short, simple and sweet remix of the song! (that's really it).
    The magic of this track relies on me combining stuff that sounds, at least to me, relaxing. Just let the ambience kick in while your seahorse lusus just, vibes at your side...
    Also this tracks makes me want to eat ice cream for some reason.

    [[Temporal Shenanigans]] was the first homestuck song I ever heard outside of the comic, and it's how I first discovered the full hs music library. Been wanting to do some sort of tribute to it for a long time. (I also just really really love Aradia

Commentary: |-
    <i>Scorpyus:</i>
    Started when I decided the [[track:discthree|Disc 3]] transition i'd made for [[album:friendsymphony|Friendsymphony]] deserved a full song. I've always loved the whole Alternian vibes, the hemospectrum and the high bloods and especially and so I decided to make a song about it. I did my best to capture in the song the grandness of Alternia, its sinister nature, and Doc Scratch's effect on the planet and this is what I got.I spent a while trying to come up with a name and eventually landed on either Blood Rite or Blood Right, either way it's sort of a pun so take that how you will.
    <i>swanfire:</i>
    Decided to focus on the handmaid and the condesce because of the female laughs in the track and also because they basically shaped the blood based society of alternia as it is. With a little nod to doc scratch through the handmaid.

Commentary: |-
    <i>cookiefonster:</i>
    If you remember my song "[[track:the-gemoni-mustard-blood-lofam4|The Gemoni Mustard Blood]]" from [[album:lofam4|LOFAM4]], that was originally from an old [[group:canmt|Cool and New Music Team (CANMT)]] album I made back in 2016 called "[[album:of-troles-and-chiptumes|Of Troles and Chiptumes]]". While I had a lot of fun making that album, over the years I've come to regard its composition and instrumentation as somewhat amateurish; I was still rather new to Famitracker, the software I used to make all those songs.
    While I had at one point wanted to remake the entire album using the chiptune skills I know today, the only song I ever ended up remaking was "[[Madame Controversielle]]", the album's song for Vriska. The remake was put on the CANMT album "troleplanet", and the reasoning behind its title was simply to take the original one and slap a 2 on it! So yes, there is indeed a Madame Controversielle 1, but I really don't get why you would want to listen to it over this version.
    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    I'm not sure about how this one turned out. All the chiptune and vriska definitely made me think of like, a retro game player select screen, so I went back to my old pixel art style, and tried to fill it with the most vriska that vriska could vriska. But it had been a while since I was working with plain pixel art again, and that probably shows.

    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    I made this song shortly after reading Detective Pony, when Dirk Strider was fresh on my mind and skyrocketing to the top of my all-time favorite characters. I wanted to do something specifically for the offscreen period between the end of homestuck and the epilogues, his journey to becoming what he is now, his acceptance of becoming the villain, etc. Mainly, just really love Dirk. Also, it's an excuse to give some love to some of his more underrated songs. (Basically anything that isn't [[Beatdown (Strider Style)|Beatdown]].) I had never even heard [[Austin, Atlantis|Austin Atlantis]] before I started on this song, and man was I missing out, so it quickly became the basis for the whole thing. In retrospect I wish I could've put [[Orange Hat]] in there somewhere, mainly just cause that's also an awesome underrated song, but by the time I remembered, this was mostly done and it wouldn't have really fit anywhere. This might be the song I'm happiest with on this album.

    <i>Tee-vee:</i>
    I was listening to Demetori as I usually do and once thought "What if the source material for their arrangements wasn't Touhou ?" and of course the first thing that came to my mind was Homestuck, so I thought I could actually run with the idea ! [[Rex Duodecim Angelus]] in all it's dark neo-classical glory seemed like the perfect track to arrange in this style, though I only kept the original melodies and ideas from it so I wouldn't have to go down a rabbit hole of character themes that could derail the intent of the arrangement. The ending section is inspired by another IP entirely (if you can guess what it is I did a fine enough job), but it seemed appropriate given the context. Very happy with how it turned out! Also the title is pretty long winded but I wanted to fit the Touhou/Demetori naming format haha.
    <i>Monckat:</i>
    Tried my best to create something as complex and intimidating as the track itself. The idea here was for the art to initially seem like random organic noise, with the Black King only popping into view on a closer look. Originally I was planning on using a lot more shading on this, some gradients and blur/glow effects too maybe. But I ultimately found it was more striking to restrict myself to only two colors. I like the idea that this is simultaneously my simplest track art in terms of color range and my most complex in terms of detail.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Monckat:</i>
    [[The Lyrist]] is one of my favorite Homestuck tracks, with its main melody being in my humble opinion the most hauntingly beautiful refrain on the whole soundtrack. Which is why it's always driven me slightly mad that said melody only appears in the first 45 seconds and never returns. And while the rest of the track is wonderful in its own right, it's never stuck in my brain quite as much.
    So the idea with this track was to attempt in my own flawed way to extend those first 45 seconds into a full track, and for the most part the way I chose to do that was to work in pieces of [[The Thirteenth Hour]] (along with adding in some original stuff). Hope you guys like it!
    The title is in reference to a baker's dozen (13), which alludes to the use of [[The Thirteenth Hour]].
    The teal and purple orbs are intended to be the orb things Alt Calliope uses to create the black hole in Act 7. My little headcanon for those orbs is that they're genesis frog frogspawn, basically embryonic universes. The idea being that since it took two universes to create the Green Sun, perhaps it takes three to destroy it.

    (WELCOME, FEMALES AND GENTLEMEN, TO THIS MUSICAL MASTERPIECE, THE FIRST HIT SINGLE
    SONG PRODUCED BY YOUR LORD, FOR YOUR LORD, ABOUT YOUR LORD. HIT IT.)
Commentary: |-
    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    There was a lot going on in the production of this, and none of it had to do with the final track. A long, long time ago, before any of my other submissions, I was going to do a Caliborn track, with the intent of being presented as a track that Caliborn himself produced. But at that time, there weren't many other submissions for this album yet, and a disturbingly high percentage of them were cherub related, so I dropped it. A year later, I was working on a remix of the afterword theme from Pesterquest, but it wasn't really clicking right. The heavy bass synths and bitcrushed drums weren't working for the style of the track. Around the same time, I finally got my hands on the incredibly elusive midi of [[track:carne-vale]], which has been my favorite homestuck song since the first time I heard it, and has yet to be dethroned. So I had the crazy notion, that the instruments I was using for my Pesterquest remix would work fantastically if I decided to go back to a Caliborn track, now that I could properly reference [[track:carne-vale]]. (I had been trying to figure out that bassline by ear for, oh lord, something like 3 years.) And, I ended up with what might be one of my favorite compositions of mine to date. Had it stuck in my head for months. Cleaned up the mixing over the next little while, and the rest is history. I had two names for it for a while, Teeth and Blood, and Space Crusader. Originally I was going to go with both, have one of those little ~ things in between, but I decided that Space Crusader, while it fit the vibe of the song, didn't really fit the vibe of Caliborn, so I dropped it.

    You guys all remember that iconic moment in [S] Collide where PM finally steals the sax that Jack's been using to play Black all this time and uses it to perform a haunting sax rendition of [[Heir of Grief]], right? Yeah me too, thought it was a perfect fit.

    I originally wrote this song in 2019 for Stable Time Loops and Paradoxes 3 but i ended up scrapping it and completely redoing it, i'm not exactly sure why i did that but either way i felt really bad about that because IMO i ended up ruining the song LOL. So anyway this is the 3rd and proper final version of Collapse AKA "The Descend of the PMT" because it references so many songs.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    This was another one that I made surprisingly quickly, and didn't need many edits afterwards. In a weird way it was inspired by David Wise's ambient synth style, cause I'd been listening to a lot of the Donkey Kong Country soundtrack, especially Stickerbrush Symphony. For a game about a monkey fighting a crocodile over a pile of bananas, that game has a surprisingly amazing soundtrack. Once I had a chord progression down I felt like it should be about the cracks in the universe, with a similar vibe to [[Do You Remem8er Me|Do You Remem8er me]], and then I eventually ended up just referencing it at the end of the track. It didn't really end up very DKC or very [[Do You Remem8er Me|Do You Remem8er me]], but both those things are far outside of my usual style so I'm not all that surprised, and what it did turn out as is something I like a lot.
    <i>Cratmang:</i>
    When you think about it, Caliborn/Lord English is kind of a tragic figure. Multiple universes of emotions, and the only one he can understand is rage and hatred. I almost feel bad for him. Almost. Where was I going with this? Oh yeah. Presenting, "Lord English throws a tantrum in a glass room."

    <i>Interrobang:</i>
    I wanted to make what's probably the last Homestuck song I'll ever release publically something special, and I think the final product here fits that bill. This track began as an experiment with the layering of different-length loops on each other in a way that would never exactly repeat itself, which you can hear in pretty clearly the first section - it's something one encounters often in minimalist and ambient music, and I'd like to do more with the technique in the future. Hope you enjoy!
    <i>Monckat:</i>
    I like to think Caliborn worked really hard on this one, maybe it's hanging over a mantelpiece in Lord English's manor somewhere. He's added some tasteful JPEG artifacts and plastic wrap filters to his style, I'm so proud of him!

    A father and son reunite. With this song I played with one of my favorite lofi ambient tricks that being recording the song to a weird audio format. In this case the song was recorded directly to a wire recorder. (the small skips and hitches you hear is the thin steel wire that will snag on the play head every now and again)
    As for the Content recorded to the wire Its a semi improvisational piece that was made to reflect John's mindstate when he reunites with his dad after the long road that was most of the comic.

    In order to really progress much further I think they'd have to start a new sburb session in Homestuck^2. So I thought I'd try to make a theme for that.
    <i>Monckat:</i>
    Based on the box art for SimCity 4. The instruments used here made my mind jump to the idea of a Maxis-made SimCity style sandbox version of Sburb, so I spoke it into existence. I have no idea how such a game would actually play but I need it now.
    Man, drawing this has made me sad there's no Spore 2 again. Dammit.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Decon Theed, repeatedScales|[[artist:repeatedscales]]:</i>
    Oh boy. I feel the best way to justify this mix of the song's entire existence is with the following; the original [[Gold Mage]] had a very barren and empty arrangement, designed to facilitate a vocal track that never actually got made, and though the lack of vocals probably helped it make [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|coloUrs & mayhem Vol. 1]] in the long run, a lot of people picked up on how empty the song felt. This mix was kind of my way of making up for that, but in the process I created the opposite problem of having TOO MUCH going on, especially in that first 'verse' section. Oh dear god, that first 'verse' section; I am baffled as to how I could possibly have thought that sounded good at the time. Technically speaking the cutting and looping on that guitar sample is very well done, but it doesn't work with the vibe of the beat, and it REALLY doesn't work with the bassline. The second 'verse' isn't much better, in that itself it's a nice chilled out rework of elements from the original, but it jars with the rest of the "GET PUMPED" vibe the tracks got going on. Also, man oh man, [[group:toby-fox|Toby Fox]] felt the solo from the end of the original song was boring; the solo on this song is utterly lifeless. It can barely be called a solo. Ok, ok, some positives; though the chorus is somewhat cluttered, I do like how punchy the chords sound using a more typical "rave stab" type sound (hell, in general the synth stabs on the cut are often the better elements), the stock sawtooth bass synth actually works quite nice with the bassline, and though it gets buried in a lot of the mix, the main drum machine beat over the 'verses' and the solo is actually quite punchy, and has a real late 90s game soundtrack vibe to it that I like. The original is definitely the better version of the song in the long run, though.
    <i>Makin:</i> (album management)
    This amazing redux version of the [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|Colours and Mayhem: Universe A]] track was hidden away in the musician's <a href="https://103records.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp</a>, known to few. It's time it saw the light of the mainstream and knocked your socks off.

    This track was made for Homestuck's 10 year anniversary back in 2019, in the span of about an hour. [[Sburban Jungle]] always felt to me like the "core" of Homestuck's extremely varied soundtrack, so I always wanted to do a take on it in some form. This didn't end up very similar to the original song, and I wasn't intending it to sound so melancholy, but neither is a bad thing.

    [[track:synchronise|[S]ynchronize]]

    I'm still wondering
    Where to go now
    We have seen the highest peak but there was 
    Nothing there no truth and how
    I'm wandering
    Through all these places
    Lands of Little Cubes and Tea 
    Of Wind and Shade, these null spaces

    I've stared at the stars, how they shine verdant dreams
    I've looked through the void, seen it crack at the seams
    I fought every challenge, these devils and gods
    They won't know what hit them

    [S]ynchronize, with every breath resounding
    [S]ynchronize, we'll see the light astounding
    [S]ynchronize, time keeps our heartbeat pounding
    [S]ynchronize, now witness space surrounding

    I'm still wandering
    In this [[Cascade]]
    See this universe we made, [[Do You Remem8er Me|will you remem8er me]]?
    These games we played?
    Our plundering
    Boonbucks and grist, [[album:prospit-and-derse|Prospit and Derse]]
    In the end we gave them
    Everything, our final verse

    I've sang with the muses, dead timelines denied
    I've hunted the wolf and seen planets [[album:s-collide|Collide]]
    I've witnessed the end of these gods and their tiers
    And no one could save them

    [S]ynchronize, see this new life we're founding
    [S]ynchronize, now with the void confounding
    [S]ynchronize, it's all our hearts still sounding
    [S]ynchronize, infinite hope abounding

    [[Showtime (Original Mix)|Showtime!]]

    [S]ynchronize, with every breath resounding
    [S]ynchronize, we'll see the light astounding
    [S]ynchronize, time keeps our heartbeat pounding
    [S]ynchronize, now witness space surrounding
    [S]ynchronize, with every breath resounding
    [S]ynchronize, we'll see the light astounding
    [S]ynchronize, time keeps our heartbeat pounding
    [S]ynchronize, now witness space surrounding

    This will be the end
    Come with me and we'll [[Ascend]]
    Solving puzzles universal
    In our [[Sburban Reversal]]
    All these [[track:ruins]] we [[Explore]]
    Could it be there's something more?
    Pester me, I'm not alone
    I'm just stuck inside my home
Commentary: |-
    <i>heir-of-puns:</i>
    So [[track:synchronise]] is just...really really good and it makes me feel a lot of things. Yeah it's vocaloid and that's funny but god DAMN it gives me chills every time I listen to it. I've been working on this cover for maybe two and a half years now? Since the Before Times definitely. It has gone through a lot of tweaks but I'm pretty proud of it overall. HUGE thanks to Ucklin for final mastering and vocals, and to CJ for the harmonies! Pronunciation of the title is up for ~interpretation~ I guess. I wanted it to be a tribute to the original title, and also just seeing the [S] in front of the next arrow always gave me a rush of adrenaline since something amazing was probably about to go down. So you click on that arrow with anticipation and launch yourself into the experience and then freak out about it on the internet afterward. Here I go getting emotional about homestuck again, wild.
    <i>Ucklin:</i>
    I wanted to put a lot of emotion and expressivity into the vocals even if that made them a bit weird! Puns was really cool and waited a long time for me to finally record them while stuff was going on in my life. I'm glad I got to work with him!
    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    You can just hear the love and effort that went into the track, it brings the nostalgia rushing back so I tried to create an art piece that would do that justice.

    Inspired by [[Sweet Dreams, Timaeus]]. I like the chill instruments and atmospheric chords from the original and wanted to do something similar.
    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    This ended up being some of the most work I've ever put into an art piece. I had the original idea for it long before it was finished, of Ult Dirk holding the broken lantern over a sleeping younger version of himself. At some point the skull got added, and the whole piece became very... I dunno how to describe it, like classical? Archetypical? Something like church stained glass, or a tarot card, and I gave Ult Dirk a halo type thing. Then a very unfinished version of it sat on my desktop for several months, just the rough outline with the colors blocked in. I slowly chipped away at it, adding details like each poster and book and the window, until finally I decided that I'd better finish this up, and did all the shading and lighting and everything in one incredibly long day. There's an alternate version without the highlight sketching, which I was unsure about, but Shwan said they liked this version better, so this is the version on the album.

    <i>Gryotharian:</i>
    Decided if this was going to be the last LOFAM album, it needed a good closing track. Not a full huge song (that honor definitely goes to and belongs to [[track:ophiuchus-full-suite-lofam5|Ophiuchus]]), just like a short little thing, the last few notes for the fandom, to wrap everything up. I think I went for a more hopeful tone, that maybe this won't be the end for homestuck's era on the internet. Maybe in another 4 years there'll be another album. Personally, I doubt it, I think the song I made is more hopeful than I am. But who knows.
    Maybe.
