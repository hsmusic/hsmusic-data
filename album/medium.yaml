    <b>4/13</b>

    Two years of Homestuck!

    But before we talk about that, let's carefully examine this fine new album by Clark Powell, who is responsible for such HS scores as [[track:three-in-the-morning|Three in the Morning]], and the Gate 1 [[track:doctor|Doctor]] remix, as well as a plethora of other album songs.

    This one's very cool. Clark has a great ambient sound, and her idea for the album was to musically express the Medium's planets, through both their elements and themes. I think she nailed it. Cover art was tag-teamed by me and Cindy (the lady who touches all your WP shirts).
