Lyrics: |-
    (THE PLACE WAS GENSOKYO, THE YEAR WAS 19720)

    I'm thinking of a number that is between my buttocks
    And that number's not between 450 and 850
    With nothing but greed capturing my heart
    Will no one just go reach inside, cast away my bad score

    Missing and unfound, undefined fantastic score
    Can't reach this debtful soul, my subterranean fruity pebble
    Seven hundred twenty desires denied by
    The embodiment of the demonic Stutzbow

    Reptile masquerade from the one debts left unpaid
    An impossible ball catch, one hundred percent delayed
    An immaterial coat missing on this freezing soul
    The imperishable rice challenging my sinful hopes
    I must keep escaping far from this perfect blosssomed yard
    Its phantasmagoric view of penumbral small white hounds
    Scarlet rhapsody police, running rotten to the core
    I won't let them or the Stutzbow destroy my credit score

    Bumper to bumper I flee, from the brothers that believe
    That my sinful soul can solve the pasta's antinomy
    Through idioms japanese, untranslatable I feel
    The Stutzbow will never stop, chasing me with endless glee
    Meme numbers won't appear, not a miracle, just fright
    As I near my final fate, my endless numeric night
    Texas history forlorn, in limbo its long lost lore
    In this realm never forgiven, not my bad credit score

    I'm thinking of a number that is between my buttocks
    And that number's not between 450 and 850
    With nothing but greed capturing my heart
    Will no one just go reach inside, cast away my bad score

    Missing and unfound, undefined fantastic score
    Can't reach this debtful soul, my subterranean fruity pebble
    Seven hundred twenty desires denied by
    the embodiment of the demonic Stutzbow

    Reptile masquerade from the one debts left unpaid
    An impossible ball catch, one hundred percent delayed
    An immaterial coat missing on this freezing soul
    The imperishable rice challenging my sinful hopes
    I must keep escaping far from this perfect blosssomed yard
    Its phantasmagoric view of penumbral small white hounds
    Scarlet rhapsody police, running rotten to the core
    I won't let them or the Stutzbow destroy my credit score

    Life insurance I can't pay, or a good bed to hide in
    Is there no place to run to, a safe haven for my sins
    Desperation swallows me, I feel wholly unprepared
    From the Bowman I can't flee, from the Stutzman mercy's rare
    Soon the brothers will catch up, meat cubes rising in the night
    Their goal easy to discern, start an unwinnable fight
    My bad credit and my life, forfeit to their endless war
    A war started with a thought, thinking of a credit score
Commentary: |-
    <i>Makin:</i> (Composer)
    An explanation of the lyrics' references to Stutzbow and Touhou lore:<br>
    I'm thinking of a number that is between my buttocks <- bowman's credit score<br>
    And that number's not between 450 and 850<br>
    With nothing but greed capturing my heart<br>
    Will no one just go reach inside, cast away my bad score

    Missing and unfound, undefined fantastic score <- undefined fantastic object<br>
    Can't reach this debtful soul, my subterranean fruity pebble <- fruity pebbles jingle, subterranean animism<br>
    Seven hundred twenty desires denied by <- ten desires<br>
    The embodiment of the demonic Stutzbow <- embodiment of scarlet devil

    Reptile masquerade from the one debts left unpaid <- chameleon, hopeless masquerade<br>
    An impossible ball catch, one hundred percent delayed <- bowman can't catch, 100%, impossible spell card<br>
    An immaterial coat missing on this freezing soul <- william henry harrison, immaterial and missing power<br>
    The imperishable rice challenging my sinful hopes <- rice challenge, imperishable night<br>
    I must keep escaping far from this perfect blosssomed yard <- perfect cherry blossom, backyard fun<br>
    Its phantasmagoric view of penumbral small white hounds <- radiation is now on youtube, phantasmagoria of flower view<br>
    Scarlet rhapsody police, running rotten to the core <- scarlet weather rhapsody, good cop red cop
    I won't let them or the Stutzbow destroy my credit score

    Bumper to bumper I flee, from the brothers that believe <- bumper to bumper<br>
    That my sinful soul can solve the pasta's antinomy <- antinomy of common flowers<br>
    Through idioms japanese, untranslatable I feel <- an apple disaster<br>
    The Stutzbow will never stop, chasing me with endless glee <- gamebro<br>
    Meme numbers won't appear, not a miracle, just fright <- MEME NUMBERS<br>
    As I near my final fate, my endless numeric night<br>
    Texas history forlorn, in limbo its long lost lore <- texas history, urban legend in limbo<br>
    In this realm never forgiven, not my bad credit score

    [...]

    Life insurance I can't pay, or a good bed to hide in <- in bed<br>
    Is there no place to run to, a safe haven for my sins<br>

Lyrics: |-
    (This is not canon to Bowmania lore. It's not lore you dunkass.)
    (Hello there, and welcome to the ASMR Factory. My name is Michael Guy Bowman, and I'll be your guide as you explore the exciting world of [[track:autonomonasty-senserational-meridisick-repose|Autonomonasty Senserational Meridisick Repose]]. Now I know what you're thinking: Mr. Bowman, can you tell us about the ASMR Factory? Why, of course, child. I've brought a few of my friends to help you experience Maximum Tingles, and we'll be taking you through a wide variety of different triggers. All in all we've got lots of fun prepared for you today, so just sit back, relax, and let the tingles help you drift away...)

    (Hi, I'm Fred.)
    (And I'm Marvin, Fred's brother.)
    (And we're... Brotheeeeeeeeeeeeeeers.)
    (You're listening to Bumper to Tingles, and we've got a great show for you today.)
    (Fred, when you're right, you're right. I happen to be eating soup, but for you, I'll keep going.)

    (And that's our show. Thanks for tuning in, everybody.)
    (I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.)

    (Well, here we are again, Sullivan. You had the gall to come to me, in my ASMR Factory and expect to get off easy. Well, it's not gonna happen, Sullivan, I can tell you that much. But listen here, Sullivan. I can still cut you a deal. I could cut you a deal, if you were talking to me. But you're not talking to me, Sullivan. You're just sitting there, with a glazed look on your face, trapped in some sort of tingle-induced coma. And I don't like that, Sullivan. You want to know why I don't like that? Because I could be at home right now, Sullivan. I could be eating a little bag of Japanese candies that I ordered from Amazon. I could be running a rake through a miniature zen garden. I could be opening up a brand new packet of Floam, and letting the individual Floam pellets run through my fingers and squish together in a Floamy coalescence. I could be giving myself a haircut right now, Sullivan, filling up both of my ear canals with shaving cream. I could be doing that right now. I could be performing unlicensed cranial nerve exams on various household animals. I could be developing a new form of communication based on chewing cubes of raw meat at varying intensities. I could be going to see my mother with a book of pressed butterflies, Sullivan. Page after page of cold, dead insects, Sullivan. I could be reading through old dream diaries, crying over nightmares I had when I was just a boy, because I'm willing to do anything, including reliving the unending horror that was my childhood, to distract myself from my crippling addiction to ASMR. I've had it up to here with how much I ASMR, Sullivan! I need hobbies to distract myself from it. I've had it up to here with you, and that glazed look on your face, and our mutual addiction to ASMR, Sullivan. So you know what? I could make a deal with ya', Sullivan. I could work something out. You, me, and my 3Dio microphone, Sullivan. We could work out a deal with the tingles. You, me, a makeshift greenscreen, Sony Vegas Pro Movie Studio 14, and a crisp unopened bag of ionized crystals, all of these things and more, Sullivan. That doesn't seem to have swayed you, huh? Well, you've left me no choice, Sullivan. I guess you're gonna have to deal with my partner. Remember him, Sullivan?)
    (RED STUFF.)
    (The ASMR will return after these short messages.)

    (I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? The number I'm thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks.)

Lyrics: |-
    (The talents of Pablo Picasso in his prime... Oh, I didn't see you there. It's me, Toby “Radiation” Fox, and I want to talk to you about the coolest and newest fandom on the internet. What, you come in here to get some tingles? People on Bandcamp will listen to anything! OHH! OHH! OHH! OHH! What fandom is it you may ask? Well, it's only for the best game ever made. You see, narratively, this game is a paragon of interactive storytelling. Every choice you make weighs on your conscience because every connection you make with the characters feels organic. Even the Pope agrees with me. In fact, he gave my game a 36 out of 5. Why, percentage wise, that'd be...)

    (720% 720% 720% 720%...)
    (How cool. How new. BUY IT.)
    (The second age of steam, the second age of steam, the second age of steam, the second age of steam, the second age of steam...)

    (Hello and welcome to your Texas History Virtual Textbook Laserdisk. The subject of this lesson is DENTAL RECORDS. As you can see here, I've got two full sets of human teeth outside my skull and inside this plastic canister. We've got a solid set of bicuspids today, and there will be plenty to be gleaned from such a pristine sample. It's a little known fact that God made man to eat leafy shit, hence the shape of your teeth. Also today's recipe. Now I'll proceed to the latter part of the lesson, in which I take the Texas Burger Bonanza Challenge, and eat 2.5 cheeseburgers in just under five seconds.)

    (Pokemon, Go to the polls, Go to the polls, Go to the polls, Go to the polls...)

    (Are you enjoying the tour of the facility? Excellent, excellent. Though, I must admit I've not been entirely straightforward with my intentions. For you see, YOU'VE FALLEN INTO MY ASMR TRAP. IT WAS ALL ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU.) (Keikaku means plan.) (Now, I will use my ASMR powers to open up a Patreon, and I'll never have to make another commission again.)

    (Hold it right there, Bowman.)
    (What? You're not supposed to be here. Get back to the factory!)
    (No. We're not gonna take this anymore.)
    (Treachery! Is no one loyal?)
    (Looks like I'm about to get some new teeth for my collection!)
    (Somebody! TREASON! MURDER! HELP!!!)
    (But nobody came.)
    (I get it.) (That was pretty good!) (Is that from that furry game?) (Really?)

    (Take this!)
    (You're backyard done.)
    (Hi-ya! Take this! How about this?)
    (You're just like my dad!)
    (You're gonna have to try harder than that!)
    (No, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
    (I'm gonna serve you for 32 days, and then you're gonna die.)
    (I'm gonna hit you with an open G so heavy it's going to resonate your whole atomic structure.)
    (That really makes me tick!)
    (This is like the Olympics of stupid.)
    (Have you ever been punched in the face? Well, you're about to.)
    (NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!)

    (Ow Ow OW Oooh Eeeh Eeeh DEATH.)

    (We did it!. Guys... let's go home. Evil laughter fades in.)
    (Those fools really thought they could defeat me. Little do they know, that I'm already 200 pages into my next novel: Pounded In The Butt By Angry ASMR Factory Workers! But as soon as that's finished, I'll get my revenge. Oh, Bowman, they'll say. Please spare us! We just wanted the ASMR! And I'll say... Bowman? There is no Bowman. There is only Chuck now. And he's going to make you tingle.)

Lyrics: |-
    And I'm not taking anything
    I'm just part of everything
    'Cause everything you have is shared
    As long as you don't know I'm there
    And I'm not missing anything
    I'm just into everything
    The stuff you hide beneath the bed
    I wonder what's inside your head

    And I'm not sure of anything
    But you, my dear, are everything
    I'm gunning it inside your car
    I'm pulling into the ER
    And I'm not saying anything
    'Cause now I'm losing everything
    They load you on the stretcher now
    I leave the keys and bail out

    I'm thinking of a number
    And it happens to be 720
    My buttocks, I'm thinking of a number
    It's my buttocks score and it's between 450 and 850

    I'm thinking of a number (My credit score)
    And it happens to be 720 (Credit score)
    (My buttocks) I'm thinking of a number (My credit score)
    It's my buttocks score and it's between 450 and 850

    The better chance at saving a lot of money
    My free credit score is between my butt-ocks
    Won't you reach in and grab it for me?

Lyrics: |-
    (—comes, it's the song, here it comes, oh yeah! Here we g—)
    (Too fast.)

    Dental records! One-hundred per cent!
    Bow, Bow, Michael Bowman
    Backyard fun!

    How does the son of a founding father of the nation
    Get appointed as a governor in charge of occupation
    Of the Indiana territory, battle with Tecumseh
    Tippecanoe, go on to become the
    President in 1841, he did it for just
    32 days and he was done cus he died
    Of pneumonia, didn't wear no coat in the rain
    Boy what were you thinking? What's your name?

    My name is Governor Fred Michael, Marvin's brother
    I will eat a series of milk jugs for commemorative purposes
    And 2 or 3 maggots in the year 1917
    And then I will bury you, you noodle brain!
    You're gonna have to deal with my partner now

    Libera me, Bowman (<i>Deliver me, Bowman</i>)
    De memes æterna (<i>From memes eternal</i>)
    In die illa tremenda, in die illa (<i>On that fearful day, on that day</i>)

    Quadringenti quinquaginta (<i>Four hundred and fifty</i>)
    Octingenti quinquaginta (<i>Eight hundred and fifty</i>)

    Septingenti viginti (<i>Seven hundred and twenty</i>)
    Tremens factus sum ego et timeo (<i>The scattering to come and your wrath</i>)
    Dum discussio venerit atque ventura ira (<i>Till the judgment be upon us, and the coming wrath</i>)

    Being a bird, being a bird, being a bird, nothing to do
    Good day, good day, being a bird, being a bird
    Bird, bird, bird, being a bird, being a bird, being a bird (BARK)
    What? (BARK) What was that? (BARK)

    What was that? Fly away, fly away, fly away
    Into the tree, in the tree, in the tree, in the tree, in the tree
    Safe! Safe now
    Safe in the tree

    Dies illa, dies iræ (<i>That day, day of wrath</i>)
    Calamitatis et miseriæ (<i>Calamity and misery</i>)

    Dental records! One hundred percent!
    Bow, Bow, Michael Bowman
    (Dies illa) (<i>That day</i>)

    (Dies magna) (<i>Great day</i>)
    Bow, Bow, Michael Bowman

    I'm thinking of a number
    (Felix natalis) (<i>Happy birthday</i>)

    Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven-hundred and twenty

    (Bow, Bow, Michael Bowman)

    This number is between my buttocks
    (Dona eis Bowman) (<i>Grant unto them Bowman</i>)
    The higher this number is (Bow, Bow, Michael Bowman)
    The better chance I have at saving a lot of money
    But the number is between my buttocks

    (Requiem æternam) (<i>Rest eternal</i>)

    I'm thinking this could save you a lot of money
    (Dona eis Bowman) (<i>Grant unto them Bowman</i>)
    If you reach in between my buttocks (Bow, Bow, Michael Bowman)
    You could save a lot of buttocks
    (Bow, Bow, Michael Bowman)

    Do you know what you can reach in between my buttocks to get?

    It's your free credit report
    And it happens to be seven-hundred and twenty

    Man it's a hot one
    Like a credit score between my buttocks
    I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks
    My free credit score

    It's between my butt
    My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
    Credit score is a dank meme
    Because it's so smooth

    I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks
    And it's between four fifty eight fifty
    It's got the kind of credit that would save me
    A lot of money

    And it's my free credit score between four and eight fifty hundred dollars between my buttocks
    And it can save me a lot of cash
    I'd rather be listening to
    The three Grammy winning hit "Smooth" by Santana and Rob Tom

    I'll tell you one thing
    I've got a number that's between my butt
    It's between four fifty and eight fifty hundred
    Seven twenty

    Have some backyard fun
    With Michael Bowman and the Stutzman too
    [[track:snow-halation|Todokete setsunasa ni wa namae]]
    You just got snowed!

    I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks
    Between four hundred fifty and eight fifty
    That number can save me a lot of money
    [[track:the-nutshack-intro|It's the nut]]

    I'm thinking of a number that's between my butt
    It's between four fifty and eight hundred dollars
    The number that I'm thinking of is between my buttocks
    Seven hundred twenty credit score are in my buttocks

    I'd rather be listening to the three Grammy
    Award winning summer smash hit "Smooth" by Santana featuring
    Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty off of the
    Multi-platinum album, I'd rather be listening to Smooth by Santana

    Some teams never make their own memes
    Never follow their dreams
    Really quite depressing

    But my team always makes up shitposts
    Never [[track:falling-for-ghosts|falling for ghosts]]
    Our rips always impressing

    Wacky warriors of the music scene
    Spending our time in C A N M T
    Living with Homestuck infamy
    Hiveswap may never be released
    At least there's C A N M T

    Some teams sort their songs with high bars
    Stupid jokes don't go far
    Don't find them appealing

    But my team never lets a gag die
    Injokes piled so high
    Can't even see the ceiling

    If stupid music's what you want to see
    You should join with C A N M T
    Our albums are all fun and free
    We even have celebrities
    Come chill with C A N M T!

    (Okay, ahem ahem. Mic test mic test. This is good okay. I'm going to also read this:)

    (I'm THINKING of a [[group:toby-fox|Radiation]] between my DVS Saxes. Do you know what it is? It's my [[group:tensei|Tensei]], and it happens to be between my [[album:strife|Strife]].)

    (I'm THINKING of a Tensei between my [[album:strife-2]]. I don't even know how to read that? [wiki note: spelled 'Striife'] Could you guess what that is? It's not Radiation, it's my [[group:undertale-and-deltarune]], which you can get for 9.99 United States dollars on Steam, trademark.)

    (I'm THINKING of an [[group:parsec-productions|AgentParsec]] between my [[group:clark-powell|Plazmataz]] and [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit]]. Could you ponder the answer to that? It's my [[artist:malcolm-brown|DragonXI]] and it ALSO is between my [[track:shadowed-slender|Slender: The Eight Pages]].)

    (I'm THINKING of a [[artist:cave-story|Cave Story]] between my [[artist:mother|Earthbound]]. I wonder if you can guess that. It is not Undertale as that is my Tensei between my Strife 2, it is actually my Homestuck.)

    (I'm THINKING of a [[group:canmt|Cool and New Music Team]] between my [[artist:o|o]]. Could you even begin to imagine what this could be? It's not my fucking Homestuck, because this whole thing sucks and is not funny.)

    (Homestuck was designed by the devil to trigger the armageddon and it seems like me writing slash reading this is yet another step towards for the doomsday machine.)

    (Fucking die in a pitfall if you find this stupid bullshit "entertaining".)
