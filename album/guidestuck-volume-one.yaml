    omg okay so

    As I said before I had originally planned to make the music for <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=932">guidestuck</a> all on my own, but the program I was using was very limited in its capabilities and I wasn’t really able to make all of the kinds of things that I wanted with it.

    SO.

    I’m turning to you, the fans, for help.

    THAT’S RIGHT, I’M ENLISTING YOU TO MAKE ME MUSIC.
    <hr>
    OKAY WELP, HERE'S GUIDESTUCK VOLUME ONE

    you can listen to these cool jams on bandcamp!!! MAKE SURE YOU CLICK EACH TRACK TO SEE THE GORGEOUS TRACK ART!!!!!

    THANKS AGAIN TO EVERYBODY WHO CONTRIBUTED??? you’re all so talented and you blew me away with your enthusiasm.

    Stay tuned for the next album contest! <3

    So I’ve just submitted a piece I wrote for [[artist:scarvenrot|scarvenrot/reindeer’s]] music contest. For those of you who aren’t familiar, she writes a fancomic of Homestuck called Guidestuck, which is way cool. You guys should check it out. Oh, and check out my song. Comment, critique, whatever.

    EDIT: Oh yeah! The song’s written with Guidestuck’s Land of Paperbacks and Moonlight in mind.

    'Quinnstrife'

    The song used in <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=932&p=269">[S] Quinn: Strife!</a> in the fanventure Guidestuck by [[artist:scarvenrot|scarvenrot]].

    Woo!

    Based partially on the tune of the song Harlequin from Homestuck.

    Big thanks to scarvenrot for using my dumb song!

    <b>Title:</b> GuideStuck - Bec Strife 2

    Okay so I edited this in quite a few ways so I deleted the old post. Sorry most of my recent posting has been on this. XD Hopefully this will be the last edit.

    This is supposed to be a strife theme for Bec, made for the Guidestuck music contest. It’s in an 8-bit style, made in Warioware DIY’s (because that’s like the only music thing I know how to use)

    EDIT: I won’t change the original post, but this was on Guidestuck’s Album 1 as “Console Wars”, a theme for Cal.

    I don’t know how many of my followers are Guidestuck fans, but the lovely [[artist:scarvenrot|scarvenrot]] used my Bec fanart as track art in her first album! I am super excited about this since I’m a closet fan of Guidestuck. You can find my art under track number 18: “Animosity” by Lea Cason. Now go listen to the album, it’s super good gogogo.
