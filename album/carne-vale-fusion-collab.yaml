    Play the fuckin-FLOOOOOOOOOOOR

    G O Game Over
    G O Game Over isn't funny

    Back to back and spinnin' on the back
    Back to back on the turntable's back
    Back to back and spinnin' on the back
    Back to back on the back to back

    Back to back and spinnin' on the back
    Back to back on the turntable's back
    Back to back and spinnin' on the back
    Back to back on the back to back

    [Little King John says something unintelligible]

    This is a certified hood classic
    [annoying crazy frog noises]

    WH-H-H-H-H-WHAT'S GOING ON? (--doin' shitty things!)

    [MORE annoying crazy frog noises]

    Big dirty stinking bass.
    Dirty stinking bass. (I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks)
    Big dirty stinking bass.
    Dirty, dirty stinking,

    Comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
    Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
    It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
    It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

    I won't be coming home tonight
    My generation will put it right
    We're not just making promises--
    ([[track:land-of-confusion]] continues playing in the background)
    
    Doors swang on niggas that got bad behavior
    My four 15's woke up the neighbors
    Interior crocodile alligator
    I drive a Chevrolet movie theater

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid

    All that glitters is gold
    Only shooting stars break the mold
    (Land of Confusion stops)

    GET DOWN GET GET DOWN
    GET DOWN DO DO DO THE HOMESTUCK
    GET DOWN GET GET DOWN
    GET DOWN DO DO DO THE HOMESTUCK
    GET DOWN GET GET DOWN
    GET DOWN DO DO DO THE HOMESTUCK
    GET DOWN GET GET DOWN
    GET DOWN DO DO DO THE HOMESTUCK
    GET DOWN GET GET DOWN (Come on and slam, and welcome to the jam)
    GET DOWN DO DO DO THE HOMESTUCK
    GET DOWN GET GET DOWN (Come on and slam, if you wanna jam)
    GET DOWN DO DO DO THE HOMESTUCK
    Like four hours to beat it!
