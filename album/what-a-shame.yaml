Lyrics: |-
    I thought society finally
    Sunk its claws inside of me
    Peacefully, quietly
    All the light had died in me
    But suddenly, violently
    The fire in my heart
    Spilled back outside of me

    Did you ever really think I'd be tamed?
    Did you ever really think I'd be sane?

    Fragile, fickle
    Jagged, prickly
    Just a monster
    Sobbing sickly

Lyrics: |-
    I wanna be your parasite
    I whisper to myself your name at night
    I wanna take all that you have
    I wanna bring you down as far as I can drag

    Which one of you's really the loyal dog?
    Which part of me really does not belong?

    [Stop acting, stop laughing
    What are you really lacking?
    Stop trying, fake smiling
    Let go his cold defiling

    You love him, he's faking
    Even your name was taken
    Perverse reverse inverse
    A boy in a hearse, a girl with a curse]

    So lie on the floor
    Stare at the wall
    And wait
    Maybe someone
    Will come
    And save you

    Everything's just the same
    I'm so glad
    That neither of us changed

Lyrics: |-
    I'm sorry but this song's a lie
    Everyone else is so alive
    This could be our real lives
    Sparkledogs with candy knives
    Black-winged angels with rainbow eyes
    Cartoon Cartoon Friday nights

    Something's gonna work out,

    If there's no place for you in this world,
    I think that you can make one still.
