Lyrics: |-
    Home, in this game we play
    Stunned, then whisked away
    Staring out into a nightmare

    Stuck years in the past
    I stepped through the looking glass
    And descended to an empty world.

    Breaking through from the ground
    Is there still hope
    Waiting here to be freed
    Can this world be restored, will it rise up
    If I planted the seeds
    Could I bring it back to life?

    Those that died, they left behind
    Cryptic writings to explain
    Four heroes once were promised
    Too late, these tablets and fossils
    All that remains

    Breaking through from the ground
    Is there still hope
    Waiting here to be freed
    Can this world be restored, will it rise up
    If I planted the seeds
    Could I bring it back to life?

    We will flood the sky
    With unearthly light
    But if every lantern dies
    Do we all fall down?

    Just a wish to sow
    So I carved our hope
    Filled it up
    Then let it go

    In a world lighter than air
    Could a dream that's lost be healed?
    The hope I held beside me
    Took flight as I entered this wasteland
    Daylight revealed

    Buried under the ground
    Is there no hope
    Waiting here to be freed?
    Like this world we'll be dead
    Will we rise up
    If I planted the seeds...

    When I fall back to sleep and I'm dreaming
    I'll look up to the clouds
    If it's out there to see, to believe in
    There's no reason to doubt

    Step out into the world
    We're not homestuck
    Take the chance to be free
    'Cause this land can't be dead
    We will rise up
    So I planted the seeds
    And I'll bring it back to life.

Lyrics: |-
    (Luck can be defined as probability taken personally, and is often described as one's belief in an intangible force, that is able to indirectly enact change in one's environment. The more favorable to one the change is, the luckier one is said to be. In contrast, strength can be defined as the measure of one's ability to directly enact change in one's environment. Therefore, though they approach it differently, luck and strength share a common purpose.)

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i> ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MNfr-CC56E))

    As evident by the title, this is intended to be a style parody of Blue Man Group, using the themes of Vriska and Equius as a base. I’ve always wanted to write a song using the PVC pipe instrument, and this seemed like a good opportunity.

    <i>Malcolm Brown:</i>

    Couldn't end my run on Homestuck without doing one last John/Showtime track! It's an orchestral smorgasbord of Ballad of Awakening, Lifdoff, Showtime and probably something else I've forgotten. Also makes use of Shepard Tones in the middle to give the impression of a constantly rising melody, (or just to sound annoying)

    Didn't quite make the Volume 10 cut, but presented here for your enjoyment! :D

Lyrics: |-
    I'm still wondering,
    Where to go now,
    We have seen the highest peak but there was nothing there, no truth, and how
    I'm wandering,
    Through all these places,
    Lands of Little Cubes & Tea, of Wind and Shade, these null spaces.

    I've stared at the stars, how they shine verdant dreams,
    I've looked through the void, seen it crack at the seams,
    I fought every challenge, these Devils and Gods,
    They won't know what hit them!

    ([S]ynchronize) With every BREATH resounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) We'll see the LIGHT astounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) TIME keeps our heartbeat pounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) Now witness SPACE surrounding!

    I'm still wandering,
    In this Cascade,
    See this Universe we made, will you remem8er me?
    These games we played?
    Our plundering;
    Boonbucks and Grist,
    Prospit and Derse,
    In the end we gave them everything, our final verse.

    I've sang with the muses, dead timelines denied,
    I've hunted the wolf and seen planets Collide,
    I've witnessed the end of these Gods and their Tiers,
    And no one could save them...

    ([S]ynchronize) See this new LIFE we're founding,
    ([S]ynchronize) Now with the VOID confounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) It's all our HEARTs still sounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) Infinite HOPE abounding!

    Showtime!

    [Instrumental]

    [Bridge: Her Imperilous Constatation]

    ([S]ynchronize) With every BREATH resounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) We'll see the LIGHT astounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) TIME keeps our heartbeat pounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) Now witness SPACE surrounding!

    ([S]ynchronize) With every BREATH resounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) We'll see the LIGHT astounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) TIME keeps our heartbeat pounding,
    ([S]ynchronize) Now witness SPACE surrounding!

    This will be the end!
    Come with me and we'll Ascend!
    Solving puzzles Universal,
    In our Sburban Reversal!
    All these Ruins we Explore,
    Could it be there's something more?
    Pester me, I'm not alone,
    I'm just Stuck inside my Home!

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i> ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsOMrYyBiV8))

    This one goes back a long ways. I wrote the first version of Bane back in 2001, originally envisioned as a final boss fight. I really liked the theme, so I made different versions of it over the years, although [[track:bane-old|the last version]] I did was about 13 years ago in 2005. Several times I considered making a new version of it for Homestuck, but I always hesitated. I finally decided to go for it, since this was my last chance.

    > (casual sunday question regarding P[S]) if you don't mind me (casual sunday question) okay so, in Veritas' preview video for P[S], ["P[S] - Album Preview"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXumGLC3zAc) and in the description for the video, Circlejourney has mixing credit "mixing by Circlejourney" for Veritas' track, Infinity's Lament that is nowhere to be found on the P[S] bandcamp page for the track or the included booklet; was this an error, and/or an overlooked detail? hopefully I don't sound too rude [[artist:lilithtreasure|- Lilith]]

    Hi! I ran it by Veri and he found that funny given that Circlejourney made the booklet themself. I’ve confirmed that Circlejourney did in fact help work on the song, so I’d say it’s probably either an overlooked detail, or something Cj themself decided wasn’t worth including. Unfortunately the particulars are lost to my personal memory, but thank you for reaching out!

    <i>Circlejourney:</i> (mixing / production, [HSMusic Discord](https://discord.com/channels/749042497610842152/779895315750715422/1213813960860635156))

    forgive me but I am a little amused (meant in the kindest way possible) that y'all ended up going to go these lengths to find this out, because I would happily have told you that I did produce Infinity's Lament and I have the stems to prove it, hahaha

    the reason I left it out is *because* I made the booklet and felt it might be too self indulgent to credit myself. but I should probably just have asked if they wanted to credit me

    P[S] is an album of Homestuck music and remixes from the official music team consisting of tracks that were cut from previous albums - most officially [[album:homestuck-vol-10|Vol. 10]], which was trimmed to 25 tracks because [[flash:4109|meme numbers]]. Get it here: Get P[S] here: [casualsunday.bandcamp.com/album/p-s](https://casualsunday.bandcamp.com/album/p-s)

    Here's my track, A Farewell to Arms, an ode to Homestuck music, and really a thank-you letter to the entire music team itself. I tried to quote something by every member of the team. Might've missed a couple people, but I tried my best. Frankly, without Homestuck music, I wouldn't be making music today. If you liked the music at all, I highly recommend tracking down what music team folks are doing nowadays - many of them could really use the support!

    (Also it's an arms joke.)
