    <i>Twix Stix:</i> (composer, project lead)

    The [[track:land-of-wind-and-shade|Doctor cover]] was the first one I made on a whim before I ever became the lead on the project, and the tracklist slowly expanded from there. The entire project was inspired by [Touhoumon](https://touhou.fandom.com/wiki/Touhoumon), and while I wasn't quite skilled enough to create the same 'remix' vibe that game had, I still wanted to include some of Homestuck's music in the game in a similar way.
    
    Every song in the album was sequenced in an actual GBA rom, not just imitated by a soundfont.

    <i>Makin:</i> (cover artist, wiki editor)

    This is the soundtrack for [Sburbmon](https://sburbmon.tumblr.com/), a Homestuck-themed mod for Pokemon Fire Red. It was composed in full by Twix Stix, who currently heads development of the mod itself.

    The album was only ever released as a zip download, and is now fully hosted on YouTube and Archive.org. Additionally, MIDIs have been extracted from the game files, and I've made a cover in the style of Fire Red's box art using a few sprites made by the Sburbmon team over the years.
