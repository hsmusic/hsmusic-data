Track: Who Am Me?
Duration: '2:48'
Artists:
- Funk McLovin

Lyrics: |-
    How do I know the me who's me is a me who's someone else?
    How can I tell for sure I'm here and not over on the shelf?
    If the me who's me is me, you see I'm not the me who's not
    And if that's all true and you are you, then the me who's you is what?
    If there's a me who's not in me, then why is that me not?
    But if he's me and not me, gee, there's a me that I forgot
    It seems I'm fragmentary very scary so be weary
    I can't be merry so find out where he may be fairly 'cause I'm only here just barely!

    If you're not me I can't be me, not me in my entirety
    But if I'm me, that's plain to see, and if I'm not me that cannot be
    If I'm not me what do I do, the me who's me has become unglued
    I guess the only way is through— oh shit, there's two lines left in this tune!
    They don't think it be like it is, but it do, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2!

    (How do I know the me who's me is a me who's someone else...)

    Paradox Space, a term used a lot in the comic and for good reason. Tried to make something EPIC that could fit the concept of exploring it. Did I get it right? I don't know... but tried to make something GRAND and so that get's to a more, calm and beautiful part<br>
    To represent every aspect of it in some shape or form.

    <i>Astroblur:</i>
    As far as I remember, the planet that Sollux was put on (in all of its weird, gross glory) had no actual song attributed to it. It makes sense, it's only very briefly shown in the story and doesn't show any sort of wider purpose, but I wanted to have a go anyway on a rendition of what I think a theme song for this area would be, in a hypothetical interactive flash game like the one where you play as John on LOWAS.

    That is in fact an actual thing I did. I don't know how long I'll be able to keep it up but I haven't failed yet. C'mon [[artist:toby-fox|Toby]], hurry it up! Make it the Champion battle theme in Pokémon: Scarlet/Violet or something.

Lyrics: |-
    This is not the answer we were looking for
    So unprepared for the treachery of life
    We did the best we could, but the best is not what's right for us, turns out

    It spiraled down so quickly
    Out of our control
    Locked in the bad ending of a cruel game
    That will end at the heat death of the universe
    It all comes crashing down
    Our smiles and optimism gone

    It took its toll
    Our youth, our families, distant friends and destinies
    When have we lost our way?

    I've seen the end
    The collapse and the mayhem, I will bring you back my friends
    Leave my past behind and try again

    A butterfly landing, planets come crashing down
    A note of desolation, a role to lead, a void to fill again
    Inessential, irrelevant

    (To us, you're a true savior, and in every sense of the word.)

    I won't go back, better an endless cycle than a deadlock of despair
    I will miss you my friends
    Change our fate, I will take the arms and rebase our mistakes
    Failures and death, I won't let it end like this

    It took its toll
    Our youth, our families, thank you for the memories
    When have we lost our way?

    I've seen the end
    The collapse and the mayhem, I will bring you back my friends
    Leave my past behind and try again

    The reunion was short, but it's just a goodbye
    I'll change our fate and see you back in time

    A song about the events post-GAME OVER, for the most part. I wasn't feeling too adventurous these days so I stayed with my default proggy-sounding-but-not-actually-that-complex rock style and the ideas came fairly easily. I've been listening a lot to Starrysky's latest album recently so I'd say inspiration came mostly from that (hence the title lol), as well as acts like Periphery or Protest The Hero or Moron Police which are usual inspirations for me I guess. Also vocal production is still relatively new for me lol

    Joey song! I feel like my homegirl is underrapresented. Based on [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit's]] great [[track:joey-play-haunting-melody]] from [[album:lofam5]], I wanted to see if I could reimagine it as a more traditional [[album:homestuck-vol-1-4]] style kid theme of sorts. Alas, I could not come up with a clever 8 letter title, but we can't always get what we want.

    I was thinking about Earth B before the game began. I composed this track in 2018, hence the old productionless piano soundfont style.

Lyrics: |-
    I hate a moral coward, one who lacks a manly spark
    I just detest a man afraid to go home in the dark
    I always spend my evening where there's women wine and song
    But like a man, I always bring my little wife along

    I'm a member of the Midnight Crew
    I'm a night owl, and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the Midnight Crew!

    The fun it doesn't stop 'til 12 on happy old Broadway
    So what's the use of going home, until the break of day
    Now, something confidential, whisper not above a breath
    I once went home at 2 AM, and scared my wife to death

    I'm a member of the Midnight Crew
    I'm a night owl, and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song!
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the Midnight Crew!

    I never shall forget the night I made six robbers run
    Although I didn't have a knife, a blackjack, or a gun
    I proved myself a hero of a very high degree
    I ran for home, and six of them, were running after me!

    I'm a member of the Midnight Crew
    I'm a night owl, and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song!
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the Midnight Crew!

    Wanted to finish a postpunk song about Jade Harley but time didn't allow for it so instead here's an arrangement of the midnight crew that was cobbled together in the last 48 hours.

    I don't make music. I'm still learning. That said, I couldn't get this particular battle theme from Hiveswap Act 1 out of my head, and decided to do something about it.

    The last time Terezi and Vriska's spent together before the world ended as scored by an emotional breakcore artist.
