    yeup. sorry it took so long. i’d kinda… forgotten about it and then i was having issues getting my hands on some album art to use and i wasn’t going to release it without album art.

    that would be irresponsible.

    anyway yes. go ahead and download it for free. just a bunch of fanventure based music.

    like i said, free. so you’ve no reason not to download it.

    go forth.

    (special thanks to [[artist:elanor-pam|paula]] for the album art. very much appreciated <3 )

    hey look another tumblrstuck related song.

    this one was me trying to come up with a battle song that would work well but didn’t feel too much like something overly epic. like my favourite battle themes were the ones that got you really pumped for combat, not the ones that were just like “ugh god, not another random battle.”

    anyway, hope its palatable.

    another chiptuney piece, potentially for redlightstuck, buuuuut that depends on if it fits. otherwise its just for your listening preference.

    this song was actually inspired by a wind up ballerina toy my mom has. fits rather will with the spinning dancer image really.

    <i>(commentary redux)</i>
    i made it for a thing for a while ago that sorta just kinda never came to be but sorta rediscovered it and kinda finished/fixed some stuff with it initially?

    idk, anyway. it kinda makes me think about something prospitian in a way so i’m probably gonna use it for my fanventure he-yup.
