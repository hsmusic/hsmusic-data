   Happy 4/13. Homestuck is getting old. I'm getting old, too. I will graduate from college and turn 22 this year. But my love of music, especially of music from Homestuck, will never get old. So here's a fun little remix of Toby Fox's "Moonsetter." Copious amounts of virtual distorted electric guitar, jazz piano, and intense rock drumming included. Enjoy.

   For some blabbery on how I arrived at the name "Moonslayer," check out the extended description.

   Why'd I call it Moonslayer? Well, I was looking for a cool edgy yet catchy little name to title this track while riffing off the Homestuck Music Team's theme of titling tracks Moon/Sun + word that starts with S. Moonsetter is the name of the original track. [[Moonshatter]] and [[Sunsetter]] are the names of a couple of Toby Fox's other Homestuck music contributions. [[Moonsweater]] is the name of a track on [[album:homestuck-vol-10|Homestuck Volume 10]] by [[artist:david-ellis|A Lunatic's Daydream]]. So you see what I mean. I considered Moonslammer, like [[Sunslammer]] by [[artist:seth-peelle|Beatfox]], but that wasn't edgy enough for me. So I settled on Moonslayer. Yeah. "Moonslayer" brings up catastrophic, apocalyptic images of destroying the moon, but not just destroying the moon-slaying it, as though the moon were a living entity capable of being conquered. A spirit. A god or goddess, maybe. A constant observer of mankind. Something personified, and then killed. Very edgy. Absolutely perfect.
