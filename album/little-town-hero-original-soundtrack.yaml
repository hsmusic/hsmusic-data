    Fun Fact: Among some early versions of songs in the game, UNDERTALE's [[track:last-episode]] goes unused in the game's files.

    <i>Morris:</i> ([album addition pull request](https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic-data/pull/473))

    references may seem a bit odd, but I tried to make the order of them as accurate as possible. Nintendo Switch DOWNLOAD SOFT COMPILATION ALBUM ([VGMdb](https://vgmdb.net/album/98119)) includes a "Concept Medley" containing [[The Fields Before Us]], [[Win by a Hair]], [[Pasmina]], [[Blood-red Carpet]], [[Neverending Roar]], and [[End the Story!]] Some of these are the same as in the final game, some are early versions (The Fields Before Us is an early version that can still be found unused in the game's files, Win by a Hair is Toby's original version while the final game has a Sato arrangement). I used this medley as the foundation of the references. In a developer interview, devs mentioned that once they got Toby for the music, he immediately layed out some main motif concepts, I presume these are what appear in the medley. Hence, for songs appearing in the medley, I point to them as the origins.

    This track listing is based on the digital-download release included with the Japanese physical release of Little Town Hero ([see VGMdb](https://vgmdb.net/album/100935)). [Little Town Hero - Big Idea Edition!](https://www.nisamerica.com/little-town-hero/) included a CD soundtrack titled "Town Tunes" ([VGMdb](https://vgmdb.net/album/95456)), and this came with 28 tracks (in a slightly different order), excluding these:

    - [[track:welcome-to-my-town]]
    - [[track:pasmina]]
    - [[track:this-is-my-town-shop-area]]
    - [[track:this-is-my-town-farm-area]]
    - [[track:lost-reminiscence]]
    - [[track:clanking-caverns]]
    - [[track:evolution-dance]]
    - [[track:tale-of-the-dark]]
    - [[track:blood-red-carpet]]

#because this version is Toby-only, I'm inclined to believe this is the origin of the melody. because Mystic Aura is in the same key, I believe it is based on this song, and then Lost Reminiscence is a re-arrange of that in a different key.

- Blood-red Carpet #both songs appear in concept medley. since the part of Neverending Roar with the "Blood-red Carpet melody" doesn't appear, but the melody does appear in the Blood-red Carpet part of the medley, I'm listing Blood-red Carpet as the origin of the melody.

    <i>Morris:</i> (wiki editor)
    The title of this song feels like it's a reference to the DELTARUNE songs [[track:a-town-called-hometown]] and [[track:you-can-always-come-home]].
