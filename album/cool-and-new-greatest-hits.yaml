Lyrics: |-
    (My name is Constable "Meme Cubes" Houston, I will eat five BIG FUCKING SHIT-FILLED ADULT hat stores in one humdrum summer day, and then my crippling addiction to pornography will be buried alive.)

    (My name is Sheriff "Pasta Man" Stutzman, I will eat five my brother Marvin in one minute, and then my copy of the Live Action Super Mario Brothers Movie on DVD will be buried alive.)

    Always wear a coat, don't die

    BOO, BOO, here come de ghost
    I'm de voodoo priest from de skeleton coast
    Trick-or-treat, trick-or-treat, you'll be stomping your feet
    'Cause I'm sugarcane sweet with a Kingston beat

    WHOA-OA-OA-OA watch out, here come de ghoul
    I be spittin' out rhyme while you playing de fool
    I'm a treetop monsta, dat dance all rasta
    Going back to de island for de sticky-sweet ganja

    (I'm THINKING of a number. Between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be 720. I'm THINKING of a number. Between 450 and 850. Do you know what it is? It happens to be 720. Which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number I'm thinking. Is between 450 and 850.)

    Second age of steam

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the best thing about morning
    Those colorful enchanting little specks
    They make my taste buds spring to life without the slightest warning
    In a way they never do when I eat Chex

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the breakfast I've been cravin'
    I shove 'em by the fistful in my trap
    They got vitamins and nutrients and even riboflavin
    And make Cocoa Puffs look like a bowl of crap

    Yeah Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are a breakfast taste sensation
    They're tiny tasty munchable and sweet
    I'd like to start a bloody war and build a Pebbles nation
    And murder every other breakfast treat

    And the gallows will sway through the night
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    All cereals bow down in fright
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Sycophants and cowards flee
    From Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Captain Crunch on bended knee
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    The balance of the world's askew
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Promise revolutions new
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    What cereal 'mongst other things
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Stays crunchy in the blood of kings?
    It's Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    (My compulsive masturbation, Sullivan! You and me, and my erectile dysfunction, Sullivan! Then I paint all the surfaces of the eggs, Sullivan! It's a mirror collage, Sullivan! DETROIT! THE PASTA CITY! The place was Russia. The year, was 1917. You're under arrest! Just kidding! I now have two complete sets of human teeth
    in
    side
    my
    head.)
