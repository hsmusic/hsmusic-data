    <i>Circlejourney:</i> (unused lyrics)
    There is a harmony to all that I see
    An unopened window to eternity
    Still kept bolted shut by a fear of the dark
    A fear for things that have yet to be

    There is a map that keeps record of the song
    The keys from divinity, untouched so long
    They're enfolded deep in the veils of the sea
    Now could it be that to free them was wrong?

    For they are our
    Road to heaven, lost forever
    Our only chance to catch a fleeing swan
    A stream of sorrow, dream unbidden
    Just an unremembered feather drifting in the sea

    Your love unfolded seven oceans to me
    There's three made of glass, three made of melody
    And we saved the last for our midnights alone
    They were my window, my map and my key

    Love, this is our
    Road to heaven, lost forever
    Our only chance to catch a fleeing swan
    A stream of sorrow, dream unbidden
    Just an unremembered feather drifting in the sea

    But I never threw my anchor when I could
    I feared, and inevitably
    The keys were lost, engulfed by frost
    Wrenched from my fingers
    Gone, our

    Road to heaven, lost forever
    Our only chance to catch a fleeing swan
    A stream of sorrow, dream unbidden
    Just an unremembered feather drifting further
    Every moment

    Road to heaven, lost together
    Our chance is gone, the swan has flown away
    A stream that longs to be a river
    Just an unremembered feather drifting in the sea
