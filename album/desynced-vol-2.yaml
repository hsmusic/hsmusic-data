    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM8gZig7xyw), excerpt)

    If I remember correctly, I wrote this track after an improv session i had on Christmas day. I thought the melody sounded pretty cool so I submitted it to the music team to see if it would fit on vol.2. I decided to make it a theme of the main group of kids and their friendship. There's not really a whole lot going on in this song, but I do think the main melody is pretty cool. Friendship truly is magic

    This song came out of the same improv session where I wrote [[Mirror Mirror]]. When I first transcribed it I thought it would make a good strife theme but I submitted it to the music team, [[artist:dizzims|Dizzy]] thought it might make a good song for Evan's Land theme instead. As a result of this suggestion I decided to make Mirror Mirror. However, I thought it might be cool to see if I could make the motif into it a strife theme. Hence the heartbreaker was born. I heavily altered the original arrangement I used for Mirror Mirror to make it sound more energetic and dynamic. I took a lot of influence from the track ["Into the Mind"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0EQ9goWZ0s) by Toby Fox as well as some touhou boss themes . While I'm not as happy with the instrumentation, I think the overall composition is pretty good and I like how I remixed Mirror Mirror.

    If it wasn't apparent already, I was on a bit of a kick writing Strife themes for vol.2 lol. I wrote Tsukuyomi as a strife theme for Momo Tanaka. The idea was to write a intense rock/metal track with Japanese instruments in the vain of [[Atomic Bonsai]] and [Fuuga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUKstGOfcVA) from Guilty Gear. I named it Tsukuyomi as a short of cheeky call back to "Moon" naming convention PB used with his track [[track:lunar-dance|"Lunar Dance."]] In hindsight maybe the naming scheme wasn't a great idea considering what role the moon plays in the comic. No I will not elaborate on what I mean by this.

    When I asked if we needed any more tracks for Vol.2, [[artist:dizzims|Dizzy]] told me that she wanted a theme for everyone's favorite gamer, Josh Summer. She and Joseph said wanted something in a similar vain to [[track:arcjecs-theme|"Arcjec's theme"]] from the Vast Error Album, [[album:catch-322|Catch 322]]. Since that's like one of my favorite tracks from the Vast Error soundtrack, I was very much chomping at the bit to do Josh's theme. In terms of actual inspiration, I took influence from Walkaround style music found on albums like [[album:alterniabound|Alterniabound]] and the aforementioned catch 322. I also took notable influence from [[track:red-sucker|"Red Sucker"]] and the works of Carpenter Brute to create this really intense electronic rock song. Also before y'all ask, the title is a reference to a tik-tok that Joseph likes.

    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YiFDpXlaAs), excerpt)

    So this is a song I've wanted to do for a long time. Early in the development of [[album:desynced-vol-1|Desynced Vol.1]], I attempted to write a theme for Yellow. Seeing as the comic was still in it's relative infancy it was a pretty big swing and miss on my part in terms of writing a song that fit them as a character. I decided to scrap it but I very much wanted to try again down the line when we knew more. Flash forward to when i got a chance to write some music for Yellow in the form [[track:asimov-3|"ASIMOV 3つの法律 (Lofi Beats To Engineer Alone To)"]] that I would get my chance. In terms of the song itself, [[artist:dizzims|dizzy]] wanted to me to take some influence from the track [[track:hip-shop|"Cool Shop"]] from the Deltarune soundtrack and write a chill song. I definitely tried my best but I do think I went a little hard towards the middle which might negate the chill vibe. I took a lot of the original melody elements from the lo-fi track I wrote for yellow and spiced it up with some swing. While I'm not the happiest in terms how the instrumentation came together, I'm glad it came together.

    I have a lot of mixed feeling towards the track, which is weird since it's the track I'm probably most known for. [[artist:dizzims|Dizzy]] asked me to make the song for the a flash that would become [S]Evan: Exit very early on into Vol.2 Development. So I tried to make a track that was a multi faceted as something like [[Umbral Ultimatum]]. However, I felt like the track was a bit of a mess in terms of actual composition. it felt like it didn't really come together like I wanted and I was pretty bummed about it. However, when it got used in the flash, I turned my opinion around on it slightly. While it might not be my favorite song I did for vol.2, I do appreciate the experience it gave me.

    I wrote this track for the scrapped walkaround flash [S]Kate:Explore. Initially for the flash, the team was going to use the track [[track:mother-dearest|"Mother Dearest"]] as the theme for the Good Dear. I personally felt that it was a bit weird to use that song for some normal deer people, so I decided to make a quick remix that was more folksy and down to earth. While the song didn't get used like I wanted, the song did give me some interesting ideas for potential gaea songs I could do in the future.

    As my last track for Vol.2, I figured that it might be fun to do a theme for Mum Henare. This song was actually my very first attempt writing something in the vain of Synth Funk/Disco, and think it turned out pretty well all things considered. I was heavily influenced by songs like ["Soda City Funk"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhIScvlFn2w) by Tim Legend and [[track:made-for-spades|"Made for Spades"]] by Cerulean. I chose the name Allegro less because the song is actually being played in Allegro and more because Allegro are described as being played in "a lively, spirited way." I felt like that description fit Mum Henare to a tee.

    So I had the idea to make an [[track:upward-movement-dave-owns|"Upward Movement"]] style song for Momo's confrontation with Lee that we see in the comic. I chopped up and Amen Break added a bit of [[Lunar Dance]] and [[Tsukuyomi]] and boom you get this track.

    So I got the idea to do this track shortly after the update dealing with Kate's past self. I thought it was an interesting moment in the comic and gave a lot of insight into kate's character. For the actual song itself, I decided to do something a littler different and try writing a very horror influenced track. The song opens with a ambient section but slowly transitions into a more distorted and violent section. I actually took a lot of inspiration from track ["Starjump"](https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/track/starjump) by Lena Raine and you can really hear it in the drums I used in the second half. The influence especially makes sense when you consider this a song dealing with a manifestation of your personal issues much like in the game Celeste.

    so I wanted to write some lo-fi hip hop for Desynced. When I asked [[artist:dizzims|dizzy]] who it would fit the best, she mentioned that something like that could fit yellow. As mentioned in my commentary for [[track:do-you-dream-of-electric-sheep|"Do You Dream of Electric Sheep?,"]] I really wanted to work on a song for Yellow for a while, so I saw this as a golden opportunity to make some music for them. When I wrote this song I tried to make a motif that I could remix into a full theme for Yellow. The end result is a bit mixed as it doesn't sound as lo-fi as it maybe could be but It was definitely a fun little diversion I did for Vol.2.

    I thought since there was a [[Desynced Anthem]] and figured a song just called Desynced would be a fun inclusion to make for Vol.2. Obviously, I took a lot of inspiration from [[track:homestuck|Mark Hadley's arrangement]] of [[track:homestuck-anthem|"Homestuck Anthem]] as well bit of influence from [[track:theme|"Theme"]] by Toby Fox. Not Really a whole lot to say about this since it's a pretty straightforward track.
